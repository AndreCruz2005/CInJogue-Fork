It was originally released in a <a href=\"/pre-release-public-testing/3015-7541/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7541\">pre-alpha</a> state via the TIGSource forums on May 17, 2009, and was later hosted online for <a href=\"/browser/3045-140/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-140\">supported browsers</a> before receiving a standalone release for <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a>, <a href=\"/mac/3045-17/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-17\">Mac</a>, and <a href=\"/linux/3045-152/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-152\">Linux</a> on June 30, 2010. The game would officially exit its Beta version on November 18, 2011, although major updates continue to be released. Since August 2011, a number of ports of the game have released for consoles and mobile devices.</p><p>Presented with a unique low-resolution <a href=\"/voxel/3015-1887/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1887\">\"voxel\"</a> aesthetic (where everything is shaped using cubes), the game allows players to interact with a variety of different \"blocks\" in a <a href=\"/randomly-generated-dungeons/3015-167/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-167\">procedurally-generated</a> world. Along with both <a href=\"/resource-gathering/3015-975/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-975\">resource mining/gathering</a> and <a href=\"/crafting/3015-934/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-934\">item crafting</a> (hence the game name), the game features exploration (with multiple biomes and locations), combat, and construction. In addition to the standard \"Survival\" mode, the game features a \"Creative\" mode that allows players to design environments with an unlimited amount of blocks at their disposal and no survival elements. The game supports <a href=\"/online/3015-559/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-559\">online multiplayer</a> and later supported numerous content packs (including new world/block textures and player skins, many of which are <a href=\"/crossover/3015-732/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-732\">cross-promotions</a> with other games and franchises).</p><p>Originally created by indie developer <a href=\"/markus-persson/3040-97855/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-97855\">Markus \"Notch\" Persson</a> (whose roles were later taken over by fellow indie developer <a href=\"/jens-bergensten/3040-99838/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-99838\">Jens \"Jeb\" Bergensten</a>), Minecraft was ported to numerous smartphones (originally known as <em>Minecraft: Pocket Edition</em>) and consoles (originally known as <em>Minecraft: Console Edition</em>, with the \"Console\" in the name being replaced by the console's name). On September 20, 2017, the game received a major \"Better Together\" update that merges the smartphone version with some console versions (including Windows 10, <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a>, and later <a href=\"/nintendo-switch/3045-157/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-157\">Nintendo Switch</a>) together for a single multi-platform version (known as <em>Minecraft: Bedrock Edition</em>, with the original computer versions renamed to <em>Minecraft: Java Edition</em>) with all features accessible (including <a href=\"/cross-platform-multiplayer/3015-4183/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4183\">cross-platform multiplayer</a>). Alternate editions include a multi-platform version for use in classroom settings (<em>Minecraft: Education Edition</em>), a cut-down version for small <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Raspberry Pi</a> microcomputers (<em>Minecraft: Pi Edition</em>), and a multi-platform version for use in <a href=\"/china/3035-343/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-343\">China</a> (<em>Minecraft China</em>).</p><p>The game has received a number of <a href=\"/spin-off/3015-1100/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1100\">spin-offs</a>, including the 2015 adventure game <a href=\"/minecraft-story-mode/3030-48413/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-48413\">Minecraft: Story Mode</a> (and <a href=\"/minecraft-story-mode-season-2/3030-59826/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-59826\">its 2017 sequel</a>), the 2020 dungeon crawler <a href=\"/minecraft-dungeons/3030-70421/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-70421\">Minecraft: Dungeons</a>, and the augmented-reality mobile game <a href=\"/minecraft-earth/3030-73461/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-73461\">Minecraft Earth</a>. As well, Minecraft's procedurally-generated sandbox elements would inspire many other games, in both 2D (such as <a href=\"/terraria/3030-34940/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34940\">Terraria</a> and <a href=\"/starbound/3030-37839/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37839\">Starbound</a>) and 3D (such as <a href=\"/dragon-quest-builders/3030-50284/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-50284\">Dragon Quest Builders</a> and <a href=\"/lego-worlds/3030-49820/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-49820\">LEGO Worlds</a>).</p><h2>Versions</h2><h3>Original / Java Edition</h3><p>The original version of Minecraft, developed using a custom engine in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Java</a>, had three major pre-release phases: pre-Alpha (including Classic, Indev, and Infdev), Alpha, and Beta. Almost every version of the Java Edition can be played in the final release via the launcher, including some versions originally not released to the public.</p><ul><li><strong>Classic:</strong> The first of the pre-Alpha versions, Classic versions were first released for free for supported browsers on May 17, 2009, lasting until November 10, 2009. These versions originally lacked survival elements (instead being a primitive version of the modern \"Creative\" game mode), and had a restricted, randomly-generated environment (surrounded by endless ocean). Online multiplayer was added on May 31, 2009, and an alternate single-player version with basic survival elements (such as enemy mobs, a health system, and a basic bow-and-arrow system) was added on September 1, 2009.</li><li><strong>Indev:</strong> Short for \"In-development\", indev was the second phase of the pre-Alpha versions, beginning on December 23, 2009 and lasting until February 23, 2010. Indev focused on the \"survival\" version of the game introduced in Classic, and added a new dynamic lighting system, crafting and inventory systems, optional map themes, specialized tools and weapons, a day-night cycle, and farming.</li><li><strong>Infdev:</strong> Short for \"Infinite Development\", infdev was the final of the pre-Alpha versions, beginning on February 27, 2010 and lasting until June 30, 2010. The name infdev was chosen as these versions revamped the terrain generator, allowing for \"infinite\" procedurally-generated terrain. In addition, this version adds more craftable items (including signs, ladders, doors, and minecarts) and more complex cave systems (including special dungeons).</li><li><strong>Alpha:</strong> Beginning on June 30, 2010 and lasting until December 3, 2010, the alpha versions were the first version to allow (and require) a paid, standalone launcher to play, rather than being playable for free in-browser. These versions added biomes, redstone circuitry, improved A.I. pathfinding, new block types (including stairs), and a new dimension (<a href=\"/the-nether/3035-3392/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3392\">The Nether</a>), alongside reintroducing online multiplayer. Most updates in this time were added as \"Seecret Friday\" updates, which intentionally left the changelog empty to let players find out what's changed.</li><li><strong>Beta:</strong> Beginning on December 20, 2010 and ending on November 11, 2011, the beta versions added numerous block and mob types (including beds and tame-able wolves), revamped the inventory system (making it easier to control and more difficult to cheat items in), and added weather effects and achievements. One of the last major updates (also called the \"Adventure Update\", released on September 14, 2011), revamped the game's biome generation while adding new combat mechanics (such as <a href=\"/critical-hit/3015-97/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-97\">critical hits</a>), an <a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience system</a>, a <a href=\"/hunger/3015-677/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-677\">hunger system</a>, <a href=\"/sprinting/3015-603/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-603\">sprinting</a>, and new pre-generated structures (such as villages). The Adventure Update also introduced a new Creative Mode, based loosely upon the original Classic verion of the game, albeit with a variety of new features.</li><li><strong>Full Release:</strong> Starting on November 18, 2011 with the 1.0.0 version of the game, the full release of Minecraft introduced an ending, including a new dimension (<a href=\"/the-end/3035-4100/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-4100\">The End</a>), a final boss (the <a href=\"/ender-dragon/3005-23814/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-23814\">Ender Dragon</a>), and a credits sequence. Updates since version 1.0.0 have added another boss (the <a href=\"/wither/3015-7579/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7579\">Wither</a>), rebalanced the combat system, greatly expanded the vertical build limit, overhauled cave generation, and added two new types of ore (netherite and copper). Starting with version 1.12.2, this version of Minecraft is known as <em>Minecraft: Java Edition</em>, to differentiate it from the multi-platform <em>Minecraft: Bedrock Edition</em>.</li></ul><p>A restricted-use demo version was first released in June 2011, bundled with that month's copy of PC Gamer Magazine. The PC Gamer demo used a pre-set world, would reset after five in-game days (roughly 100 real-time minutes), and used the Beta 1.3 version of the game (although more recent versions existed at the time). On August 1, 2012, versions of Minecraft after Full Release 1.3.1 would begin a similarly limited demo for users not logged into an account.</p><p>On May 7, 2019, an early version of the game (0.0.23a_01) was re-made using a custom engine in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">JavaScript</a> for <a href=\"/browser/3045-140/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-140\">supported browsers</a>, in celebration of the game's 10th anniversary of development.

Known out-of-game as the \"Bedrock\" version, the Android, iOS, and Windows 10 versions use a unified codebase and support <a href=\"/cross-platform-multiplayer/3015-4183/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4183\">cross-platform multiplayer</a>. In addition, three console ports were re-released with this new codebase (also with cross-platform multiplayer support):</p><ul><li>The <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a> version, which was released digitally by Microsoft on September 20, 2017.

Once selected, game mode can only be changed via console commands.</p><p>In addition, server owners for some versions of the game can enable special <a href=\"/player-vs-player/3015-346/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-346\">player-vs-player</a> multiplayer minigames using custom maps.</p><h4>Survival</h4><p>Survival Mode is the base game mode of Minecraft, starting players empty in an open <a href=\"/randomly-generated-maps/3015-206/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-206\">procedurally-generated</a> world. Players must explore the world, collect resources, upgrade their gear, battle hostile mobs, and manage both their health and their <a href=\"/hunger/3015-677/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-677\">hunger</a>.</p><p>The game has no <a href=\"/never-ending/3015-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1467\">pre-determined goals</a> outside of fighting the Ender Dragon, however players can work on the game's <a href=\"/achievements/3015-29/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-29\">achievements and advancements</a>, and can build new structures to their heart's content.</p><p>While playing Survival Mode, players can choose from four difficulty levels for their world:</p><ul><li><strong>Peaceful</strong> - Hostile and potentially-hostile mobs cannot spawn naturally. Changing to this difficulty from others removes all hostile and potentially-hostile mobs from the world. Health and hunger gradually replenish on this difficulty.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Easy</strong> - Hostile mobs and potentially-hostile mobs can now spawn, although they deal reduced damage and most <a href=\"/damage-over-time/3015-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-370\">damage-over-time</a> effects aren't present. Additionally, zombies can't turn villagers into zombie villagers. When the hunger meter is fully depleted, the player's health begins to drain down until it reaches 50%.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Normal</strong> - Hostile mobs and explosions now deal standard damage to players. When the hunger meter is fully depleted, the player's health begins to drain down until it reaches 5%. Certain hostile mobs now have additional attacks. Villagers killed by Zombies have a 50% chance of becoming a Zombie.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Hard</strong> - Hostile mobs and explosions now deal even greater damage to players. When the hunger meter is fully depleted, the player's health begins to drain down to 0% (causing them to die from starvation). Certain mobs are now more likely to spawn with weapons and armor. Zombies can now break down doors and spawn reinforcements, and villagers killed by zombies now always become zombie villagers.</li></ul><p>In addition, the Java Edition has a bonus <strong>Hardcore</strong> game mode, which locks the difficulty to Hard while disabling the Bonus Chest, cheat commands, and <a href=\"/permanent-death/3015-431/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-431\">the ability to respawn</a> after death (only allowing dead players to spectate the world).</p><h4>Creative</h4><p>Creative Mode allows players to build structures freely with no resource or inventory management, no crafting, no combat, and no health or hunger management. Players have an alternate inventory that allows them an infinite selection of almost all blocks and items in the game. They can also toggle <a href=\"/flight/3015-350/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-350\">the ability to fly around freely</a> by double-jumping.</p><h3>Starting Out</h3><p>When creating a new game in Minecraft, a world is generated and the player is spawned at a random spot. That spot is the player's spawn point, as well as the permanent world spawn point (however players can change their spawn point by sleeping in a bed). As the player moves around, the world will generate in 16x16 segments of blocks, known as chunks. The world is created of same-sized blocks, most commonly dirt, sand, and stone. Everything in Minecraft revolves around obtaining these blocks, placing them in the world, and crafting them into useful items.</p><p>To collect blocks, the player left-clicks on a block and cracks will appear in it. If they continue to left-click until the cracks fill the block, the block will shatter dropping a miniature version of itself (or a particular material depending on the block type). The time it takes to collect a block depends on the block the player is collecting and the tool (if any) that they are using. Most mineral-based blocks will require the proper tool to be harvested (stone will not yield cobblestone unless mined with a pick, snow tiles will not yield snowballs unless harvested with a shovel, etc.). Once collected, initial blocks will be placed into the player's hotbar (from left to right), with spillover collecting into the rest of the player's inventory. To place a block, equip it in the hotbar (with either the mouse wheel or corresponding number key) and right-click on another block. [NOTE: Some blocks when collected will yield an item instead of a block (such as diamond or coal) this item cannot be placed and right-click will do nothing.] Take care when using tools as using the incorrect tool on a specific block type will waste two uses of the tool instead of just one (for instance, using a pickaxe on a tree).</p><p>Collecting blocks is only the first part of playing Minecraft, then comes crafting, which is more important. In the inventory screen (Default hotkey: E) there is a 2x2 square grid used for crafting. To craft an item, the player must place the correct ingredients in the correct shape in the grid. Some items can be created with very simple diagrams (i.e. a single block of wood will create four wooden planks), while others can be very complicated. One very important early game craft is to create a workbench (which allows players to craft in a 3x3 square allowing them to create more advanced items). A workbench is created with four planks; one placed in each spot of the 2x2 grid.</p><p>Once players have crafted a workbench, the next step is crafting tools like shovels and axes. These allow players to gather blocks more quickly and collect more advanced blocks. After a player makes tools the rest of the game is up to them. Players can mine for rare ore, build elaborate structures and much more.</p><h3>Weather</h3><p>As of Beta version 1.5, Minecraft has weather in the form of rain, snow and thunderstorms. Rain will occur, if rarely, in all biomes except desert, tundra and taiga, and snow will only fall in the tundra and taiga biomes, or at a certain altitude. Instances of both of these weather effects will last approximately 15 minutes, and thunderstorms may occur during either. During thunderstorms the world becomes darker, enough so that enemy mobs may spawn even during the dau, and lightning strikes setting fire to the block it hits. Snow fall will cover most blocks in snow and cause water to freeze and become blocks of ice.</p><h3>Recipe Book</h3><p>Added in Full Release version 1.12, the recipe book stores any crafting recipes that the player has learned, allowing for quick reference in the future. Recipes are learned upon meeting pre-determined conditions, such as picking up certain items involved in the recipe, or through crafting a previously unlearned recipe.</p><h2>Items</h2><p>While there are a considerable number of items in Minecraft, they can largely be split into a number of categories, listed below:</p><h3>Tools</h3><p>Tools are used to perform specific tasks. Certain tools (the shovel, pickaxe, axe, and hoe) can be built out of different materials (wood, stone, iron, gold, diamond, and netherite).</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tool Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Shovel</td><td>Shovels are used to harvest \"soft\" blocks, such as dirt, gravel, clay, and sand. They are also the only tools which can harvest snowballs from snow.</td></tr><tr><td>Pickaxe</td><td>Pickaxes are used to harvest stone, ores and other \"hard\" blocks. No other tool can yield drops from any of these blocks.</td></tr><tr><td>Axe</td><td>Axes are used for harvesting wood, and also double as a slow yet powerful weapon.</td></tr><tr><td>Hoe</td><td>Hoes are used for tilling soil into farmland.</td></tr><tr><td>Flint and Steel</td><td>Flint and Steel is used to set other blocks on fire.</td></tr><tr><td>Bucket</td><td>Buckets are used to hold water, lava, milk, snow, and fish. Contents of a bucket can usually be placed by right-clicking.</td></tr><tr><td>Compass</td><td>The Compass points towards the player's spawn point, unless in the Nether, in which case it goes berserk.</td></tr><tr><td>Fishing Rod</td><td>The Fishing Rod is used to catch fish from bodies of water, as well as to pull land mobs toward the player.</td></tr><tr><td>Clock</td><td>The Clock gives a general indication of the time of day.</td></tr><tr><td>Map</td><td>The map gives an overview of a large area, although the player must uncover it from <a href=\"/fog-of-war/3015-14/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-14\">fog of war</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Shears</td><td>Shears are used to collect delicate items like wool, leaves, and cobwebs. As well, they can be used to carve pumpkins for crafting jack o'lanterns.</td></tr><tr><td>Fire Charge</td><td>Used in a similar fashion to flint and steel. Can also be weaponized by firing out of dispensers.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Items built of different materials have varying durabilities. Durability denotes the number of times an item can be used before it breaks and must be replaced. Gold is 33, wood is 60, stone is 132, iron is 251, diamond is 1562, and netherite is 2031. Gold, however, harvests standard blocks slightly faster than all other tools, including netherite. Durability of items with only one material type varies depending on the item.</p><h4>Armor</h4><p>Armor reduces damage taken from physical attacks by enemy mobs.</p><p>With the exceptions of helmets and elytra, every type of armor can be made from the following materials: leather, gold, chainmail, iron, diamond, and netherite. Helmets can be crafted from each of these materials, as well as a sixth material: turtle shell. Elytra can not be crafted and have no associated material.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Helmet</td><td>Helmets are worn over the player's head. They provide approximately 15% of a full set of armor's damage reduction.</td></tr><tr><td>Chestplate</td><td>Chestplates are worn over the player's torso. They provide approximately 40% of a full set of armor's damage reduction.</td></tr><tr><td>Leggings</td><td>Leggings are worn over the player's legs. They provide approximately 30% of a full set of armor's damage reduction.</td></tr><tr><td>Boots</td><td>Boots are worn over the player's feet. They provide approximately 15% of a full set of armor's damage reduction.</td></tr><tr><td>Elytra</td><td>A special kind of armor, elytra can not be crafted and provide no defense benefit. However, when equipped in the chestplate slot, elytra allow the player to glide by holding in mid-air. Using a firework while gliding will boost the player upwards.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Different materials provide different amounts of protection. A full set of leather provides 7 points, gold provides 11 points, chainmail provides 12 points, iron provides 15 points, diamond provides 20 points, and netherite provides 20 points. These values combine with a number of other factors to determine how much damage the player takes from an attack.</p><h4>Combat Items</h4><p>The most direct method of protection against oncoming mobs and players alike, there are a number of combat items available to the player.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sword</td><td>Swords are the primary melee weapon in Minecraft. They can also be used to swiftly cut through leaves and cobwebs. Its durability ratings are the same as those for the tools above.</td></tr><tr><td>Axe</td><td>A tool as well, axes can be used as an incredibly strong, albeit fairly slow, weapon.</td></tr><tr><td>Trident</td><td>A rare item, tridents can be used in melee, as well as thrown at enemies.</td></tr><tr><td>Shield</td><td>A defensive item, shields can be used to block most projectiles, as well as reduce damage taken from incoming attacks.</td></tr><tr><td>Bow</td><td>Bows can be used to launch arrows. Upon use the bow's arrow will be pulled back, increasing its damage the farther it is drawn.</td></tr><tr><td>Crossbow</td><td>Crossbows are a more advanced type of bow. The potential damage dealt by a crossbow is lower than that of a bow, but they can be pre-loaded in preparation of a fight, and can also be loaded with fireworks.</td></tr><tr><td>Arrows</td><td><p>Arrows act as ammunition for bows and crossbows. They are dropped by slain skeletons, and can be crafted from feathers, sticks and flint.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Firework</td><td><p>Fireworks are an ammunition type only usable with crossbows. Fireworks explode upon contact, <a href=\"/splash-damage/3015-347/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-347\">dealing damage in a radius</a>.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Swords and axes can be crafted from several materials (wood, stone, iron, gold, diamond, and netherite), increasing their durability and damage output.</p><h3>Food</h3><p>The player must eat to stay alive. Eating enables the player to regenerate health, as well as sprint, swim, and perform other physically demanding tasks.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Points</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Beetroot</td><td>1</td><td>Grown using beetroot seeds, or found in villages.</td></tr><tr><td>Dried Kelp</td><td>1</td><td>Made by cooking kelp in a furnace, smoker, or campfire.</td></tr><tr><td>Potato</td><td>1</td><td>Can be grown or found in villages.

There are four kinds of mobs: passive, neutral, hostile, and utility.</p><h3>Passive Mobs</h3><p>Passive Mobs will not attack the player under any circumstances.</p><p><b>Cow</b></p><p>Cows are useful for a variety of reasons, from dropping leather and steak upon being killed, to providing milk when interacted with using a bucket. In certain biomes, a variant known as the mooshroom spawns, which functions like a regular cow, with the exception of giving off mushroom stew when interacted with using a bowl. If the mooshroom is fed a flower before using the bowl, it will give off suspicious stew, a food item giving a random potion effect.</p><p><b>Pigs</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273883-pig.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273883\" data-ratio=\"0.92699724517906\" data-width=\"726\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 726px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:92.7%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273883-pig.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273883\"><img alt=\"A pig\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273883-pig.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273883-pig.png 726w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/38/386689/3273883-pig.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px\" data-width=\"726\"></a><figcaption>A pig</figcaption></figure><p>Pigs drop pork chops when killed, which originally served as the primary source of healing in the game. If a pig is struck by lightning during a thunderstorm then it will become a zombified piglin; a mob otherwise only found in the hell underworld of the Nether. Saddles can be placed on pigs, allowing the player to ride on their back, however their movement can only be controlled using a carrot on a stick.</p><p><b>Chickens</b></p><p>Chickens can be killed for feathers; feathers are used to make arrows. If left alive, however, chickens can leave eggs on the ground. Since the beta 1.8 Adventure Update, chickens drop raw chicken when killed which can be cooked in a furnace.</p><p><b>Sheep</b></p><p>Originally sheep could be punched with any non-tool to shear them for 1-3 blocks of wool. After Beta version 1.7, however, punching sheep only hurts them. Instead, sheep must now be trimmed using shears which harvest 1-3 wool per sheep, with wool regrowing when a sheep eats grass.</p><p><b>Squid</b></p><p>Introduced in Beta 1.2, these mobs spawn only in water, and slowly suffocate if pushed onto land. While these animals are completely peaceful, they can be killed to gain ink packets, which can be turned into black dye. As of Java Edition 1.17, a variant known as glow squids will sometimes spawn, dropping glow ink sacs, which can be used to make certain blocks glow.</p><p><b>Villagers</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273850-villager.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273850\" data-ratio=\"2.0121951219512\" data-width=\"410\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 410px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:201.2%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273850-villager.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273850\"><img alt=\"A basic Villager\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px\" data-width=\"410\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273850-villager.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273850-villager.png 410w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A basic Villager\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273850-villager.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273850-villager.png 410w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px\" data-width=\"410\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A basic Villager</figcaption></figure><p>Villagers are the NPCs who spawn in procedurally-generated villages. Originally they were meant to have names, though every last one of them had \"Testificate\" in their name plate -- a nickname that has stuck with them since their inception.</p><p>Villagers can be given jobs using special blocks, although some will generate already having jobs, due to villages generating said blocks. Once a villager is employed, they will trade with the player, offering various items in exchange for emeralds, as well as vice versa. Villagers' perception of the player is improved upon trading or otherwise helping them, however, attacking a villager will decrease their perception of the player. A village's perception of the player will impact the prices offered when trading.</p><p>Villages are common targets for attack, with zombies attacking at night to turn villagers into zombie villagers, and illagers attacking at certain times to destroy the village. During either event, villagers will run into the nearest house, seeking shelter. If a village is large enough it may attract an iron golem, which will fight hostile enemies automatically, defending the village.</p><p>A variant of the villager, known as the wandering trader, will sometimes spawn near the player. The wandering trader spawns with two llamas, and will offer random trades to the player for one in-game day, before disappearing at night.</p><h3>Neutral Mobs</h3><p>These mobs will leave the player alone until provoked. The action causing provocation and the behavior of the mobs after they have been provoked differs between mobs.</p><p><strong>Piglin</strong></p><p>Only found in the nether, adult piglins will attack the player on sight, unless they are wearing a piece of golden armor. Adult piglins wield golden swords and crossbows, however baby piglins lack weaponry, and will not attack the player whatsoever. Additionally, piglins will attack the player if the player attacks a piglin, or touches a block which contains items or gold. Piglins can be given gold ingots, at which point they will give the player a random item, even if they were previously hostile towards the player.</p><p>Zombified Piglin</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273851-zpiglin.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273851\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 450px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.3%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273851-zpiglin.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273851\"><img alt=\"A zombified piglin\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273851-zpiglin.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273851-zpiglin.png 450w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A zombified piglin\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273851-zpiglin.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273851-zpiglin.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A zombified piglin</figcaption></figure><p>Only found in the Nether, zombified piglins are peaceful with the player and will not attack unless provoked. They passively wander around and make sounds crossed between pigs and zombies. They become hostile and make loud angry shrieks when attacked or damaged, at which point any other zombified piglins in the area will also become hostile. A group of zombified piglins will generally overwhelm a single player. They wield Golden Swords and drop rotten flesh and gold nuggets upon death. They were originally zombie pigmen, however they were changed to be zombified piglins in Java Edition 1.16, with the introduction of piglins.</p><p><b>Wolves</b></p><p>Introduced in Beta 1.4, wolves are the game's first tameable pet. They can be tamed by feeding them 5-6 bones. Once tamed, hearts will appear and a red collar is present on their neck. The player can tame more than one. The wolves will follow the player character and teleport to them if they get too far away. If the player right-clicks on them they will sit, and if the player feeds them pork chops they will regain health. Their health meter is represented by their tail (vertical tail is full health, lowered is low health). They will attack any players or mobs that the player character attacks, and defend them. Mobs will not attack them. In the wild they are neutral but will attack if provoked. They are somewhat rare but commonly found in forest-type areas.</p><p><b>Ocelots</b></p><p>Introduced in Full Release 1.2, ocelots only spawn in jungle biomes, and purposely hunt down and kill certain passive mobs nearby. Ocelots scare easily and will flee at high speeds (the only mob currently capable of sprinting) if the player moves or even <em>looks around</em><i> </i>too suddenly near them, but will readily approach if the player holds raw cod or salmon in their hand. Feeding the ocelot will cause it to become trusting of the player, at which point it will no longer flee from them. Ocelots scare away creepers, and are immune to fall damage, but will not stick by the player's side like wolves do.</p><p><strong>Cats</strong></p><p>Originally obtained by taming an ocelot, cats became their own mob in Java Edition 1.14, spawning near villages and behaving similarly to ocelots. Cats are tamed in the same way as trust is gained with ocelots, but can be leashed before taming. Similarly to ocelots, cats are immune to fall damage and scare away creepers, as well as phantoms. There are 11 variants of cat, each based on real-life cat breeds, however the differences between them are purely visual.</p><p><strong>Horse</strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273854-horse.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273854\" data-ratio=\"1.085\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:108.5%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273854-horse.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273854\"><img alt=\"A white horse\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273854-horse.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273854-horse.png 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A white horse\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273854-horse.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273854-horse.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A white horse</figcaption></figure><p>Added in Full Release 1.6, horses are another tameable mob, such as wolves and cats. Horses are tamed by feeding them certain food items, or by attempting to ride on their back enough times. Once tamed, the player can put a saddle on the horse to ride it around, providing a faster means of transportation than walking. Horses can also be equipped with <a href=\"/horse-armor/3055-507/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-507\">horse armor</a>, protecting them from attacks. A variant of horses, the donkey, can also spawn. Donkeys can not be given horse armor, and are slower than normal horses, however they can be equipped with chests, allowing for easy transportation of large quantities of items. If a horse is bred with a donkey, the resulting offspring will be the otherwise unobtainable mule, which behaves like a donkey, albeit with a more wildly varying run-speed. Mules can not be bred with any other animal, even other mules.</p><p><strong>Llama</strong></p><p>Added in Full Release 1.11, Llamas function similarly to horses, donkeys, and mules, although they move slowly on their own, and can not be directed through riding. Instead, llamas are useful for carrying items long distances, accomplished by equipping them with a chest and items, and then leading them along with a lead. If one llama is led with a lead, nearby llamas will follow suit. If a llama or their owner are attacked, every nearby llama will spit at the attacker, damaging them slightly.</p><p><b>Enderman</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1851496\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1851496\"><img alt=\"An Enderman\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"An Enderman\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>An Enderman</figcaption></figure><p>A slight reference to the popular internet creepypasta <a href=\"/slender-man/3005-23838/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-23838\">Slender Man</a>, endermen were added in Beta 1.8.

Incredibly powerful, with high health and a strong attack, golems are completely harmless to the player unless deliberately provoked. On occasion, iron golems will approach villager children and present them with roses, a reference to a scene from the film <i>Castle in the Sky</i>. Although they will automatically engage zombies and illagers upon detecting them, iron golems will also do battle with any mob that damages a villager in it's vicinity. They will also protect the player in this manner, making them handy to have around. The player can also construct their own golems, using iron blocks and a jack o'lantern.</p><h3>Hostile Mobs</h3><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273855-zombie.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273855\" data-ratio=\"1.6778711484594\" data-width=\"357\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 357px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:167.8%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273855-zombie.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273855\"><img alt=\"A common zombie\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px\" data-width=\"357\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273855-zombie.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273855-zombie.png 357w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A common zombie\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273855-zombie.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273855-zombie.png 357w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 357px) 100vw, 357px\" data-width=\"357\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A common zombie</figcaption></figure><p>Spawning only in poorly lit areas (such as during the night, or when underground), hostile mobs readily attack the player when they get near. Each enemy type has its own special traits, and can be damaged with any item, however, items specifically intended as weapons (such as axes, swords, bows, and crossbows) are the most effective ways of combatting them.</p><p><b>Zombie</b></p><p>The most basic of enemies, zombies are slow and moan incoherently. They can only attack from a close proximity, and will slowly walk toward the player once they see them. Zombies ignore any non-player mobs nearby with the exception of villagers, wandering traders, and iron golems, who they will attack. Villagers killed by zombies turn into zombie villagers (although zombie villagers can also occur naturally), but can be cured with a potion of weakness and a golden apple. Aside from zombie villagers, three variants of zombies exist: chicken jockeys, husks and drowned. Chicken jockeys are rarely spawning baby zombies which ride on the back of chickens. Husks only spawn in deserts, and behave much like normal zombies. Drowned spawn in water, or when a normal zombie is underwater for too long. Naturally spawning drowned have a small chance to spawn with a trident, the only natural way of obtaining one in the game. Only normal zombies, zombie villagers, and chicken jockeys will catch on fire in direct sunlight, as husks are adjusted to hot desert climates, and drowned do not leave the water. When killed, zombies drop rotten flesh, with a rare chance to drop farming materials or iron ingots.</p><p><b>Skeleton</b></p><p>Skeletons are ranged opponents; only getting close enough to fire arrows at the player. Their movement patterns often involve circling the player as they get closer. Skeletons make a bone-clattering sound, but are more often identified by the sounds of their arrows being fired. Three variants of skeleton exist: spider jockeys, strays, and wither skeletons. Spider jockeys are skeletons which ride on the back of spiders, granting them faster movement speed than normal skeletons. Strays only spawn in snowy biomes, and fire arrows which inflict slowness upon the player. Wither Skeletons only spawn in Nether fortresses, and wield swords rather than bows. Wither Skeletons drop wither skeleton heads, a requirement for summoning The Wither. Skeletons drop bones and arrows when killed and all variants catch fire in direct sunlight, except for Wither Skeletons, who are immune to fire.</p><p><b>Spider</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273881-spider.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273881\" data-ratio=\"0.73020527859238\" data-width=\"341\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 341px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.0%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273881-spider.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273881\"><img alt=\"A spider\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px\" data-width=\"341\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273881-spider.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273881-spider.png 341w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A spider\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273881-spider.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273881-spider.png 341w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px\" data-width=\"341\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A spider</figcaption></figure><p>Spiders are dangerous foes, due to their ability to climb sheer walls. They move somewhat slowly but leap at the player once they are in range to do so. They are also only a single block tall but two blocks wide, allowing them to slip under narrow gaps. They make loud hissing noises and have no footsteps. Spiders are docile during the daytime, but will still attack if attacked first. A spider that becomes hostile to the player during the night will remain hostile to the player even once the sun rises only giving up once the player dies or it does. They have one variant, the cave spider. Cave spiders only occur undeground in mineshafts, and behave like a regular spider. Unlike regular spiders, however, cave spiders are smaller, and poison the player upon attacking. Both spiders and cave spiders drop string and spider eyes when killed.</p><p><b>Creeper</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/131021/1796814-200px_twocreepers.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1796814\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.015\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:201.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/131021/1796814-200px_twocreepers.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1796814\"><img alt=\"A creeper\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/131021/1796814-200px_twocreepers.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/131021/1796814-200px_twocreepers.png 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A creeper\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/131021/1796814-200px_twocreepers.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/131021/1796814-200px_twocreepers.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A creeper</figcaption></figure><p>Creepers are easily the most iconic mob in Minecraft, and are among the most dangerous. They have movement patterns almost identical to zombies, but Creepers make absolutely no noise unless within attack distance, at which point they will make a loud hissing noise (similar to lighting the fuse of an old-fashioned bomb), at which point they swell up and explode. This leaves the player about one second to get out of the blast radius, or to hit the creeper out of distance. The explosion is 75% the strength of TNT, and like TNT it destroys blocks around it and does less damage the further the player character is from the epicenter. If the player can distance the creeper from themself quickly enough, it will not explode, but will continue approaching the player until killed. Creepers drop gunpowder when killed by normal means but will not drop anything if they detonate. They also drop a vinyl record if they are killed by a skeleton's arrow. If a lightning bolt strikes near a creeper, they will become electrified and supercharged, causing their explosion to be much larger and much more powerful, often enough to kill a player in one hit. Creepers do not burn up in direct sunlight.</p><p><strong>Illager</strong></p><p>Illagers are evil versions of villagers, typically found in woodland mansions, illager outposts, or in raiding parties attacking villages. Visually similar to villagers, albeit with gray skin and different clothes, illagers are strong enemies which will attack the player on sight, and can destroy entire villages if not stopped. There are three types of illager: Pillagers, Evokers, and Vindicators. Pillagers carry crossbows and occur in raiding parties which attack villages every so often. Evokers have no weapon, instead casting various spells to attack their targets. Vindicators appear passive at first glance, however they will pull out an axe and begin running towards their target whenever they approach. Evokers and Vindicators both spawn naturally in woodland mansions, as well as spawning during later waves of village raids. Code for a fourth type of illager, the Illusioner, exists in the Java Edition of the game, however it is not present in the game itself except through use of commands or modifications.</p><p><strong>Phantom</strong></p><p>Phantoms are a special mob, only spawning when the player has not slept for three or more in-game days. They spawn in the sky above the player, circling overhead before swooping down to attack. They continue to spawn until the player rests in a bed, although they will catch on fire in direct sunlight. Upon death, phantoms sometimes drop phantom membranes, which can be used for powerful potions and repairing rare items.</p><p><b>Slime</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676246\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.77162629757785\" data-width=\"289\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 289px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676246\"><img alt=\"Some slimes\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" data-width=\"289\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png 289w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Some slimes\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png 289w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" data-width=\"289\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Some slimes</figcaption></figure><p>Slimes are a rare enemy that only spawn deep underground in specific chunks of the world, or in swamps. Their attack is similar to a spider's, as they simply jump towards the player, albeit not as ferociously. Slimes can spawn in various sizes, and split apart when attacked. The smallest slimes cannot do damage to the player, but will still follow them around. They also can only move around by jumping making plopping sounds as they land. When killed they drop balls of green slime, which can be used to create sticky pistons and a number of other items.</p><p><strong>Guardian</strong></p><p>Guardians are a type of oceanic mob which only spawn in ocean monuments. They attack from a distance, swimming around to avoid the player while staying close enough to attack them. Within the heart of ocean monuments exists a variant of guardian, the Elder Guardian, which has significantly more health, does more damage, and inflicts mining fatigue on all nearby players.</p><p><strong>Magma Cube</strong></p><p>Magma cubes are similar to slimes, although they only spawn in the Nether, where they occur almost everywhere. They sport more health than a slime, deal more damage, and even deal damage when at their smallest size, unlike slimes. They are also immune to lava. When killed they drop magma cream, which can be used for potions of fire resistance.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676248\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3976608187135\" data-width=\"342\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 342px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:139.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676248\"><img alt=\"A Ghast\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px\" data-width=\"457\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png 342w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A Ghast\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png 342w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px\" data-width=\"457\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Ghast</figcaption></figure><p><b>Ghasts</b></p><p>Found only in the Nether, ghasts are huge, floating creatures, characterized by their constant moaning when idle and blood-curdling screams when attacking. They launch explosive fireballs at the player that will destroy surrounding blocks, much like a creeper's explosion. It is possible to bounce the fireballs back at the ghast either by timing a hit on it with a sword or by shooting it with a bow and arrow. If a ghast manages to hit the player's portal to the real world with its fireball, the portal will close and will need to be re-ignited if the player wishes to leave. When ghasts are killed they drop gunpowder and ghast tears, valuable potion ingredients.</p><p>Originally, ghasts were intended to have a small chance of spawning near nether portals when the player returned to the overworld, however this was never implemented. In possible reference to this, there is a secret advancement for bringing a ghast to the surface, by drawing it through a nether portal.</p><p><strong>Hoglin</strong></p><p>Spawning in groups in the Nether's crimson forest biomes and in bastion remnants, hoglins are large, warthog-esque mobs. They attack players that get within 32 blocks of them, flinging the player into the air. If a hoglin somehow makes it out of the Nether, it will quickly zombify, turning into a zoglin. Upon death, a hoglin drops raw porkchops and leather, providing a valuable source of food in the Nether for those willing to pursue the dangerous mob.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/150889/2281097-blaze.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2281097\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/150889/2281097-blaze.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2281097\"><img alt=\"A blaze\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/15/150889/2281097-blaze.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/15/150889/2281097-blaze.png 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A blaze\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/15/150889/2281097-blaze.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/15/150889/2281097-blaze.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A blaze</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Blaze</strong></p><p>Blazes are mobs found in the Nether, usually spawning from monster spawners inside of Nether Fortresses.

When killed by the player they will drop Blaze rods, an item necessary for making potions, as well as for reaching The End.</p><p><strong>Shulker</strong></p><p>Shulkers are a special mob only found in End Cities, special structures spawning in the outer reaches of the End. They normally conceal themselves as purple boxes, but will pop out and attack upon a player's approach. Getting hit by one of their projectiles will cause the player to take damage, as well as levitate for a few seconds before falling back down. Killing a shulker will drop a shulker shell, a prerequisite for making shulker boxes, a special storage item allowing players to carry far more items in their inventory.</p><h3>Boss Mobs</h3><p>Boss mobs are unique even among hostile mobs, due to their massively increased health, more complex AI, and the greater requirements to find and fight them. When a player is near a boss mob, a <a href=\"/enemy-health-indicator/3015-6203/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6203\">health bar</a> will appear at the top of the screen, showing how much health the boss still has.

She can only be found in the End dimension, where she will spawn naturally upon a player's first arrival. The Ender Dragon flies around the main island of the End, occasionally swooping down to knock the player into the air, turning towards the player to shoot a fireball at them, temporarily burning the ground where the fireball lands, or flying towards a structure in the center of the island and stopping there briefly. As the Ender Dragon flies around, ender crystals positioned on the End's many obsidian towers will slowly regenerate her health, making it paramount that the player destroy the crystals before fighting the Ender Dragon.</p><p>Upon the dragon's death, the structure in the center of the End will complete itself, filling in with an inky void-like block, which when stepped in will show the player the game's credits and send them back to the Overworld. As well, an Ender Dragon egg with no functional use will appear atop the structure, and End gateways will appear at the outer rim of the island, allowing players to go to the far reaches of the End. The dragon can be resummoned by placing End crystals around the central structure, allowing it to be fought again. However, fighting it again will not spawn additional dragon eggs.</p><p><strong>The Wither<br /></strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3277988-wither.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3277988\" data-ratio=\"1.0286085825748\" data-width=\"769\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 769px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:102.9%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3277988-wither.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3277988\"><img alt=\"The Wither\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" data-width=\"622\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/38/386689/3277988-wither.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3277988-wither.png 769w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/38/386689/3277988-wither.png 622w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Wither\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/38/386689/3277988-wither.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3277988-wither.png 769w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/38/386689/3277988-wither.png 622w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" data-width=\"622\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Wither</figcaption></figure><p>The second boss mob to be added to Minecraft, the Wither was introduced in Java Edition 1.4.2. The Wither is summoned by placing three Wither Skeleton skulls onto a T-shaped configuration of soul sand or soul soil, destroying the used items and spawning the Wither. When first spawning, the Wither is stationary for a moment as its health bar fills up, at which point it will explode, dealing damage to the surrounding environment and any nearby mobs, and make a sound audible to every player in the world, beginning the fight. The Wither tends to hover a few blocks above the ground, and fires exploding projectiles at all nearby mobs as it flies. In the Java Edition, getting the Wither below half health causes it to become immune to projectile damage, as well as flying closer to the ground. On Bedrock, it will create a sizable explosion, spawning three Wither Skeletons, and causing the Wither to take reduced damage for the rest of the fight.</p><p>Upon its death, the Wither drops a Nether star, an item required to create beacons, powerful structures which grant positive status effects to all players within a certain range.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>Most of the music and sound design for Minecraft was provided by <a href=\"/daniel-rosenfeld/3040-99250/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-99250\">Daniel \"C418\" Rosenfeld</a>, however later expansion packs and updates would introduce a number of songs from other composers. <a href=\"/gareth-coker/3040-140700/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-140700\">Gareth Coker</a> provided the music for every expansion pack made for the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft, while <a href=\"/lena-raine/3040-189371/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-189371\">Lena Raine</a> would provide four new songs (Chrysopoeia, Rubedo, So Below, and Pigstep), added in the 2020 Nether Update.</p><p>The game's soundtrack was released on March 4th, 2011, under the name <b>Minecraft: Volume Alpha</b>.

href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> (via <a href=\"/steam/3015-718/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-718\">Steam</a>) on May 16, 2011. Along with numerous updates, it was ported to a variety of platforms throughout the years.</p><p>Originally built in five months with the XNA Framework by a small team (led by <a href=\"/andrew-spinks/3040-100113/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-100113\">Andrew \"Redigit\" Spinks</a>, best known for his <a href=\"/super-mario-bros/3025-1899/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1899\"><em>Super Mario Bros. X</em></a> fangame), Terraria is a 2D platformer with elements of <a href=\"/minecraft/3030-30475/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30475\">Minecraft</a>, putting emphasis on exploration, <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/mining/3015-1753/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1753\">mining</a>, <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/crafting/3015-934/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-934\">crafting</a>, and combat with hostile creatures in a <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/procedural-generation/3015-328/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-328\">procedurally-generated</a> <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/sandbox/3015-453/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-453\">sandbox</a> environment. As players earn their footing by crafting better equipment, they progress through the game by defeating <a href=\"/bosses/3015-229/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">bosses</a> found throughout the world (one of which makes the entire game harder while unlocking new ores for better equipment and new biomes to explore).</p><p>Along with numerous updates over the years (enhancing the world generation system and light rendering while adding a large variety of new monsters, items, and gameplay mechanics), the game was released DRM-free on other digital storefronts (including <a href=\"/gogcom/3015-2379/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2379\">GOG.com</a> and the Humble Store) on October 2, 2014 and was made compatible with <a href=\"/mac/3045-17/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-17\">Mac</a> and <a href=\"/linux/3045-152/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-152\">Linux</a> systems on August 12, 2015.</p><p>The game was also ported by <a href=\"/engine-software-bv/3010-1704/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1704\">Engine Software</a> to numerous seventh- and eighth-generation consoles (including the <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a> starting in early 2013, the <a href=\"/playstation-vita/3045-129/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-129\">PlayStation Vita</a> starting in late 2013, the <a href=\"/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a> starting in late 2014, the <a href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">Nintendo 3DS</a> starting in late 2015, and the <a href=\"/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a> starting in mid-2016) and by <a href=\"/codeglue/3010-6668/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6668\">Codeglue</a> to numerous <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"/android/3045-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-123\">Android</a>, and <a href=\"/windows-phone/3045-124/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-124\">Windows 10 Phone</a> devices (starting between late 2013 and late 2014). These ports were released both digitally and in retail by <a href=\"/505-games/3010-277/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-277\">505 Games</a> (in North America and Europe) and <a href=\"/spike-chunsoft/3010-8152/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-8152\">Spike Chunsoft</a> (in Japan, with the exception of the 360 and XONE versions). The 360 and PS3 versions were also released in a <a href=\"/collectors-edition/3015-1521/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1521\">Collector's Edition</a>, featuring a USB memory stick (resembling the game's pickaxe).</p><p>A spin-off to the game, titled <a href=\"/terraria-otherworld/3030-48857/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-48857\">Terraria: Otherworld</a>, was in development by Re-Logic alongside <a href=\"/pipeworks-studio/3010-11846/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-11846\">Pipeworks Studio</a> (who took over after Engine Software left the project). Set in an alternate dimension within the Terraria universe, players would have had to restore a once-pristine world from a never-ending wave of \"corruption\". In April 2018, it was announced that development on Otherworld had been cancelled.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Terraria invites the player to explore or dig for building materials, while also continually spawning monsters off-screen. The game challenges the player to immediately start to come up with solutions to questions of shelter, housing, protection, fast travel and ultimately aesthetics and automation. Different armors, weapons, equipment and access to NPCs and Bosses add RPG like progression and enable the player to seek out increasingly difficult depths and environments. Player characters can travel between different offline worlds and online servers, thus making all resources infinite, encouraging heedless creativity, rather than economical resource management.</p><p>The worlds in Terraria are <a href=\"../../randomly-generated-maps/92-206/\" rel=\"nofollow \">randomly generated</a> based on the size of the world selected by the player, with several defined Biomes:</p><ul><li>Forest</li><li>Snow Biome</li><li>Underground Layer</li><li>Cavern Layer</li><li>The Underworld</li><li>Corruption</li><li>Jungle and Underground Jungle</li><li>Dungeon</li><li>Ocean</li><li>Desert</li><li>Floating Islands</li><li>Space</li><li>The Hallow and Underground Hallow (late game)</li><li>Meteorite</li><li>The Crimson (an alternative to The Corruption released in v1.2)</li></ul><p>Each zone spawns a specific set of monsters, treasure, ore, and/or plants. For examples, glowing mushroom biomes will have large mushrooms instead of trees, <a href=\"http://wiki.terrariaonline.com/The_Corruption\" rel=\"nofollow \">The Corruption</a> has dark, corrupted versions of normal enemies, and Hell is filled with lava and demons.</p><p>Water and lava exhibit dynamic properties, and the creeping growth of plants, crystals, and even corruption and hallow mean the world is constantly shifting, almost beyond the player's ability to control i. There is also one <a href=\"../../randomly-generated-dungeons/92-167/\" rel=\"nofollow \">randomly generated dungeon</a> per world for the player to explore. Pots and <a href=\"../../treasure-chest/93-517/\" rel=\"nofollow \">treasure chests</a> will be randomly placed for players to find valuable accessories to equip with game-altering affects, such as a \"Red Baloon\" that increases jump height, or \"Hermes Boots\" that improve run speed.</p><h3>Crafting and Building</h3><p>Buildings and items are created using materials the players gather themselves from the world. Trees can be chopped down and replanted, and various types of dirt and ore can be gathered. Some <a href=\"../../crafting/92-934/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Crafting</a> stations are created by placing objects on or near each other (For example, placing flasks on a table makes an <a href=\"../../alchemy/92-1233/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Alchemy</a> station) while others such as Furnaces are crafted from other items and then placed on a flat surface</p><p>While a number of certain items (such as crafting tables, platforms, torches, some types of ammo, and more) can be crafted by hand, most require a crafting station to use. The types of crafting station are as follows:</p><ul><li>The workbench allows the player to create basic objects and miscellaneous objects such as walls and basic tools.</li><li>The Sawmill allows for the creation of higher grade wooden objects, primarily wooden furniture.</li><li>The Loom allows for the crafting of silks and vanity items.</li><li>The Furnace allows the player to craft ore into bars. Later upgrades allow processing endgame ores such as hellstone.</li><li>The Anvil allows the player to craft metal bars into tools, armor, and more. Later upgrades allow creating endgame items.</li><li>The Alchemy Table is used to create potions, with a 33% chance to not consume ingredients.</li><li>Various specialized crafting stations allow for crafting specific sets of items, or are used to craft a small number of items.</li></ul><h3>Player Advancement</h3><p>Players have no improvable stats beyond health and mana. Health increases by finding and breaking open underground Heart Containers with a pickaxe, dropping a Life Crystal item which allows for a permanant 20-point HP increase, up to a cap of 400 HP. After the player has killed the Plantera boss in a world, life fruit will spawn in the Jungle, increasing the maximum HP cap to 500 HP. Mana is increased by collecting 10 falling stars (which only appear at night), and combining them into a Mana Star, which increases maximum mana by 20 points (maximum mana caps out at 200 before accessory modifications).</p><p>Beyond those two stats, player advancement is accomplished by improving their equipment and accessories via exploration, discovery of chests, and destruction of monsters and bosses.</p><h3>NPCs</h3><p>NPCs are attracted to player-built structures based on certain conditions met by the players in the game. The NPCs are attracted by closed off rooms or \"houses\" that they can each claim as their own and can be assigned to different rooms via the housing interface. For example if all players have 50 silver, a merchant will appear. If a player has more than the default starting health, a nurse will appear.</p><p>The basic criteria for a \"house\" are:</p><ul><li>Side and back wall, floor, and ceiling. Back wall made out of something other than dirt or dungeon brick.</li><li>Must have a table/workbench and a chair.</li><li>Must have an exit, either a wood platform in the floor or ceiling or a door.</li><li>Must have a light source.</li><li>Must be at least 8 blocks wide and 4 blocks tall.</li></ul><p>As of 1.4.0.1, NPCs have a happiness mechanic, tied to various conditions of their house. Being too close to too many other NPCs, living in a biome they like or dislike, or living near another NPC they like or dislike will all impact their happiness, causing their prices to fluctuate accordingly.</p><p>There are 29 total NPCs in the game, however only 26 of them can become permanent residents of a world. Before entering hardmode, the NPCs that can move into a world are the <a href=\"/the-guide/3005-20766/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20766\">Guide</a> (who is present from the start of a new world), <a href=\"/the-merchant/3005-20768/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20768\">Merchant</a>, <a href=\"/the-nurse/3005-20777/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20777\">Nurse</a>, <a href=\"/the-demolitionist/3005-20778/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20778\">Demolitionist</a>, Dye Trader, Angler, Zoologist, <a href=\"/the-dryad/3005-20780/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20780\">Dryad</a>, Painter, Golfer, <a href=\"/the-arms-dealer/3005-20779/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20779\">Arms Dealer</a>, Tavernkeep, Stylist, Goblin Tinkerer, Witch Doctor, <a href=\"/the-clothier/3005-20805/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20805\">Clothier</a>, Mechanic, and Party Girl. In hardmode, they are joined by the Wizard, Tax Collector, Truffle, Pirate, Steampunker, Cyborg, Santa Claus, and the Princess. As well, the Zoologist sells pet licenses, which allow three pet NPCs (a cat, a dog, and a rabbit) to live with a chosen NPC, improving nearby NPC happiness.</p><p>The NPCs which can not permanently move in to a house are the Old Man (who becomes the Clothier upon Skeletron's defeat), and the Skeleton Merchant and the Traveling Merchant (both of whom spawn randomly at the beginning of each day, and disappear at the end of each day.)</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p>The game is designed with multiplayer in mind, so players can start a server and invite friends. The player character can be used in any of the player's worlds, and online servers as well. When starting a server, it can be hosted on any world. This can save a lot of repetition of advancing a character or world when wanting to play with friends. Flags exist for Player versus Player game modes, with choices of team color to set player damage. Certain items exist with player/terrain damage in mind, such as thrown grenades that only hurt players and bombs that damage both players and terrain.</p><h2>Updates</h2><p>Terraria has received over fifty updates since release.

developer <a href=\"/eric-barone/3040-74541/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-74541\">Eric Barone</a> (under the studio name <a href=\"/eric-barone/3010-12176/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-12176\">ConcernedApe</a>) and digitally published by <a href=\"/chucklefish-games/3010-8380/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-8380\">Chucklefish</a> for the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> on February 26, 2016. It was made available to <a href=\"/mac/3045-17/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-17\">Mac</a> and <a href=\"/linux/3045-152/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-152\">Linux</a> platforms on July 26, 2016 and was later ported to numerous consoles (alongside numerous updates).</p><p>Built in the same vein as the <a href=\"/harvest-moon/3025-301/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-301\">Harvest Moon</a> and <a href=\"/rune-factory/3025-996/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-996\">Rune Factory</a> series, players control a <a href=\"/customizable-characters/3015-155/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-155\">customizable</a> resident of the isolated <a href=\"/rural-area/3035-1597/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1597\">rural</a> region of Stardew Valley. After feeling burdened by their office job in the city, the player character moves to the region after obtaining the deed to their grandfather's neglected <a href=\"/farm/3035-2306/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2306\">farm</a>, where they work to get it restored.</p><p>While maintaining their farmland, players can build <a href=\"/support-relationship/3015-2860/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2860\">relationships</a> (both friendly and <a href=\"/romance/3015-253/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-253\">romantic</a>) with the villagers in and around Pelican Town, learn new trades (including <a href=\"/mining/3015-1753/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1753\">mining</a> and <a href=\"/fishing/3015-510/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-510\">fishing</a>), encounter numerous fantasy creatures (some of which are friendly), and attempt to revitalize the region (by either restoring the town's Community Center or paying the antagonistic <a href=\"/corporation/3015-5746/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-5746\">Joja Corporation</a> to refurbish it).</p><p>Originally a solo project that took four years of development, Stardew Valley later received numerous post-release updates with assistance by both <a href=\"/chucklefish-games/3010-8380/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-8380\">Chucklefish</a> and <a href=\"/agm-playism/3010-9072/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-9072\">Playism</a> (for localization). These include new late-game content, more game mechanics and events, improved UI and polish, and multiplayer support (for up to four players).</p><p>The game was also ported by <a href=\"/sickhead-games/3010-12196/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-12196\">Sickhead</a> to the <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a> and <a href=\"/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4</a> on December 14, 2016, with a retail release by <a href=\"/505-games/3010-277/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-277\">505 Games</a> on April 11, 2017. As a special <a href=\"/collectors-edition/3015-1521/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1521\">Collector's Edition</a>, the retail release features a <a href=\"/original-soundtrack-release/3015-189/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-189\">soundtrack CD</a> and poster of the in-game map. It was later ported to the <a href=\"/nintendo-switch/3045-157/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-157\">Nintendo Switch</a> on October 5, 2017 and will receive a <a href=\"/playstation-vita/3045-129/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-129\">PlayStation Vita</a> port sometime in 2018.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>The core gameplay of Stardew Valley is a farming simulation and employs the typical conventions of many simulation games, such as a <a href=\"/daynight-cycle/3015-92/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-92\">day/night cycle</a> and <a href=\"/seasons/3015-339/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-339\">seasonal</a> changes. Farming gameplay involves tilling soil and planting various seeds, as well as maintaining and eventually harvesting the resultant crops. Eventually the player can keep livestock, which are not slaughtered for their <a href=\"/meat/3055-267/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-267\">meat</a>, but instead generate animal products such as <a href=\"/egg/3055-607/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-607\">eggs</a> and <a href=\"/milk/3055-912/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-912\">milk</a>.</p><p>While the game's primary focus is farming, Stardew Valley also features <a href=\"/fishing/3015-510/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-510\">fishing</a>, <a href=\"/foraging/3015-4174/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4174\">foraging</a>, <a href=\"/mining/3015-1753/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1753\">mining</a>, a combat system and scripted social events. Players can customize their farm's layout, craft special items and decorations, and get to know the townsfolk personally through quests and <a href=\"/present/3055-1291/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1291\">gift</a>-giving. There are a total of ten romance options (five bachelors and five bachelorettes) and no restrictions regarding same-gender marriage.</p><p>The player can choose to try and revitalize Pelican Town's derelict <a href=\"/town-hall/3035-2892/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2892\">Community Center</a> to unlock various improvements for the town, or they can side with the mega-corporation Joja and pay cash to gain success. There is a local library/museum that accepts donations of artifacts and precious minerals, as well as a mouse merchant who sells unique hats that become available after unlocking specific Steam Achievements.</p><h3>New Game</h3><p>Stardew Valley features several <a href=\"/customizable-characters/3015-155/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-155\">character customization</a> options when beginning a new game, including gender, skin tone, hairstyle and clothing. Players can also choose their farm's name and their \"favorite thing,\" which is sometimes referenced in dialogue. Animal preference determines whether the player will later receive a cat or a dog as a farm pet.</p><p>New arrivals in Stardew Valley are greeted by Robin, the local <a href=\"/construction/3015-1090/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1090\">carpenter</a>. Robin escorts the player to their grandfather's farm, which has become completely overgrown after years of neglect. After meeting Mayor Lewis of nearby Pelican Town, the player is given a basic set of tools and a starter packet of Parsnip seeds with which to begin their new farming operation. Lewis also recommends that the player introduce themselves to the Valley's other residents as the new farmer. After the introductory sequence, gameplay is largely open-ended, allowing players to set their own goals and explore the world at their own pace.</p><h3>The Farm</h3><p>Players manage their farm plot in order to earn income from crops, animal produce and artisan goods. However, the land must first be cleared of obstructions such as trees, shrubs and rocks before any crops or structures can be created. The player's farm plot also contains their Farmhouse, which can be upgraded by bringing cash and raw materials to Robin. Players can sell items by placing them inside a convenient Shipping Box located near the Farmhouse; Mayor Lewis collects the contents of the box each night and sells them on behalf of the player at their standard prices.</p><p>Additional buildings can be constructed on the farm by Robin, such as <a href=\"/chicken-coop/3055-2725/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2725\">chicken coops</a>, <a href=\"/barn/3035-2716/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2716\">barns</a> and horse <a href=\"/stable/3035-3207/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3207\">stables</a>. Players can restore the destroyed Greenhouse on the northern edge of the farm by completing the Pantry quests in the Community Center, allowing any seeds planted inside to grow regardless of the current season.</p><p>After reaching 25,000G in total earnings, Demetrius offers to improve the cave behind the Greenhouse for free. He gives players the choice of installing a habitat for fruit bats, which generate random Fruit, or grow boxes for fungi which generate random Mushrooms.</p><p>Grandpa's Shrine can be found in the farm's northwest corner. Inspecting the Shrine reveals a letter asking the player to \"wait for my return at the dawn of the third year\".</p><h3>Tools</h3><p>Players rely on tools to shape their farm plot and gather certain resources. Several Tools can be upgraded by Clint at his <a href=\"/blacksmith/3015-4337/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4337\">blacksmith</a> shop, which increases their efficiency. Upon arriving in Stardew Valley, the player is given a set of five basic tools:</p><ul><li><strong>Hoe</strong>: The farmer's signature tool of the trade, Hoes are used to till soil. Once tilled, Fertilizer and Seeds can be planted on a soil tile.</li><li><a href=\"/scythe/3055-95/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-95\"><strong>Scythe</strong></a>: Nearly as ubiquitous as the Hoe, the curved Scythe slices tall grass and shrubs with ease. If a Silo has been constructed, cut grass will be automatically deposited as Hay for livestock feed.</li><li><a href=\"/axe/3055-437/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-437\"><strong>Axe</strong></a>: Standard trees and stumps are no match for the trusty Axe, but it must be upgraded to Copper-grade in order to chop tougher Hardwood logs.</li><li><a href=\"/pickaxe/3055-1934/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1934\"><strong>Pickaxe</strong></a>: Players can break stones and mine ore with the mighty Pickaxe. Upgraded picks can break larger stones.</li><li><a href=\"/watering-can/3055-1834/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1834\"><strong>Watering Can</strong></a>: Plants need water to grow, and this humble vessel fills the role nicely.</li></ul><p>Four additional Tools can eventually be acquired through scripted events, quests or by purchasing them from the appropriate vendor.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/fishing-rod/3055-360/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-360\"><strong>Fishing Rod</strong></a>: A bounty of aquatic species can be snagged by skillful fishermen. Willy gifts a basic Bamboo Rod to the player in an early scripted event and will eventually sell better Rods for purchase.</li><li><strong>Milk Pail</strong>: Used to collect raw Milk from livestock.</li><li><strong>Shears</strong>: Wool can be harvested from Sheep with a sharp pair of Shears.</li><li><strong>Copper Pan</strong>: Once unlocked, players can use this to pan for mineral ore in streams.</li></ul><h3>Crops</h3><p>Seeds can be bought from Pierre's General Store or earned by completing Community Center quests. They can only be planted on soil tiles that have been tilled with a hoe; once planted, the crop must be watered daily to stimulate growth. Different crops require varying growth periods, and most crops can only be grown in certain seasons. Any planted crops with seasonal requirements will die at the beginning of the next non-viable season.</p><p>Various kinds of fertilizer can also be added to tilled soil prior to planting seeds. Each type of fertilizer grants a different beneficial effect, such as faster plant growth or higher-quality crops.</p><p>In addition to replanting common Acorns, Maple Seeds and Pine Cones to grow new trees on the Farm, several kinds of fruit tree saplings can also be purchased at Pierre's. Unlike standard crops, trees do not require watering and won't die following a seasonal change, making them viable long-term investments.</p><h3>Energy &amp; Health</h3><p>Using a hoe, wood axe, pickaxe, fishing rod or watering can consumes Energy, which is displayed as a <a href=\"/stamina-bar/3015-3569/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3569\">bar</a> marked with the letter \"E\" in the lower-right corner. In addition to sleeping in the Farmhouse's bed, Energy can be restored with certain consumable items or by visiting Stardew Valley's local Spa.</p><p>Players that stay awake past 12:00 AM will receive a warning that \"it's getting late\". Going to sleep after midnight reduces the total amount of Energy recovered by the next morning. If the player does not reach their bed by 2:00 AM or uses up their entire Energy reserve, they will pass out on the spot from exhaustion. When this occurs, the player will awaken the next morning with only half of their total Energy restored and an invoice from Harvey for medical services rendered.</p><p>A Health meter appears next to the Energy bar while players are in the Mines or the Secret Woods. Like Energy, Health can be restored by sleeping, visiting the Spa or using consumables. If a player's health reaches zero, they will pass out and be woken up by one of the other villagers. Players that pass out due to health loss may randomly lose some of their inventory items, in addition to paying a heftier medical fee to Harvey.</p><h2>Points of Interest</h2><p>Stardew Valley is a lush and largely undeveloped region located in the Ferngill Republic. It contains the village of Pelican Town, as well as a number of other natural and artificial landmarks that can be discovered in the surrounding areas.</p><p>Certain characters refer to the ongoing <a href=\"/war/3015-479/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-479\">conflict</a> between the Ferngill Republic and the Gotoro Empire, an opposing nation located on the opposite side of the Gem Sea.</p><ul><li><strong>The Farm</strong>: The player's farm is located just west of Pelican Town. It is the only area in which players may plant and harvest crops, build structures and keep their livestock.</li><li><strong>Pelican Town</strong>: A quaint little village nestled in the heart of Stardew Valley. <ul><li><strong>Pierre's General Store</strong>: Pierre owns and operates a general store in the village square that sells a wide assortment of seeds, fertilizer, groceries and other sundries.</li><li><strong>Harvey's Clinic</strong>: A complete lack of <a href=\"/hospital/3035-1187/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1187\">hospitals</a> in Stardew Valley means that residents must rely on Harvey's modest clinic for medical services. Maru also works in the Clinic as Harvey's assistant on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</li><li><strong>The Stardrop Saloon</strong>: Pelican Town's <a href=\"/bar/3035-1999/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1999\">bar</a> is a popular hangout for locals. It is run by Gus, the friendly barkeep and chef.</li><li><strong>Museum</strong>: Stardew Valley's Museum features several exhibit displays that can be filled with donations such as precious minerals and other rare artifacts. Its sole staff member Gunther rewards repeat donors with unique gifts. The Museum also contains library bookshelves that hold any Books discovered by the player.</li><li><strong>Blacksmith</strong>: Clint runs Pelican Town's smithy and provides valuable services such as upgrading certain Tools and breaking open Geodes to reveal their mineral contents. He also sells several varieties of metal ore.</li><li><strong>Community Center</strong>: Pelican Town's disused Community Center is initially locked, but Mayor Lewis will unlock the door permanently in an early scripted event. After stepping inside, players will discover strange creatures called Junimos that refer to themselves as the \"keepers of the forest\". With some magical assistance from the Wizard, the player comes to understand the Junimos' language. They can choose to assist the friendly sprites in restoring the Community Center by completing \"Bundles\" consisting of specific items in exchange for rewards.</li><li><strong>JojaMart</strong>: A modern <a href=\"/supermarket/3035-1567/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1567\">supermarket</a> owned by the powerful Joja Corporation. While convenient, JojaMart's presence has had a profoundly negative impact on Pelican Town's local economy. Morris, a loyal Joja representative, works tirelessly to attract new customers and expand Joja's presence in Stardew Valley. Shane also works at JojaMart, albeit with less enthusiasm than his manager Morris. If the player chooses to purchase a JojaMart Membership from Morris, this leads to the Community Center's acquisition by Joja Corporation, and the replacement of the old building with a new Joja Warehouse.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Cindersap Forest</strong>: A large wooded area to the south of the Farm offering a variety of foraging items and fish waiting to be harvested. A livestock farmer named Marnie sells animals raised on her farm, which sits on the northern edge of the forest. On Fridays and Sundays, a Traveling Cart arrives in the forest to sell unique goods. <ul><li><strong>Wizard's Tower</strong>: A reclusive Wizard practices magic in his Tower on the forest's western edge.</li><li><strong>Secret Woods</strong>: Players equipped with the Steel Axe can break a fallen log in the northwest corner to gain access to the Secret Woods, but they should be wary of the resident Slimes living there.</li><li><strong>Hat Shop</strong>: After unlocking at least one Achievement, a talking mouse moves into the abandoned house on the southern edge of Cindersap and opens a hat shop.</li><li><strong>Sewer</strong>: Raw sewage drips from a locked grate in the southeast corner of Cindersap, which can later be opened with Gunther's Rusty Key. The sewer tunnel also connects to a manhole in Pelican Town.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Pelican Beach</strong>: Ocean debris constantly washes onto the sandy southern coast of Stardew Valley, making this the destination for beach-combers. Willy owns a small Fishing Shop adjacent to the docks, where he sells bait, tackle and fishing rods.</li><li><strong>Carpenter's Shop</strong>: Located north of Pelican Town, Robin runs a workshop attached to her family's home. She can assist the player with building new structures on their Farm as well as upgrading existing ones, including the Farmhouse. Robin's services require both cash payment and a bundle of raw materials, particularly wood and stone. She can also demolish any unwanted buildings except the Farmhouse.</li><li><strong>Stardew Spa</strong>: Weary players can take a relaxing soak in the Spa's heated bathhouse to recover their Energy and Health. The path leading north from the Carpenter's Shop to the Spa is initially blocked, but an earthquake occurring early in the first Summer opens the way. A railroad track lies just behind the Spa; trains sometimes pass through the Valley on this rail line and occasionally drop valuable items for the player to retrieve.</li><li><strong>The Mines</strong>: A series of dark caverns filled with all manner of dangerous creatures. Bold players can delve into the Mines in search of valuable mineral ore and other treasures, provided that they can defend themselves from the bloodthirsty monsters who lurk inside.</li><li><strong>Adventurer's Guild</strong>: Conveniently located just to the east of the entrance to the Mines, veteran adventurer Marlon sells new armor and weapons inside the Adventurer's Guild hall. Marlon allows players to join his Guild after they have defeated ten Slimes.</li><li><strong>Quarry</strong>: Further east past the Adventurer's Guild lies a large Quarry which periodically generates stone and mineral ores. However, the bridge leading to the Quarry has collapsed and must be repaired first.</li><li><strong>Calico Desert</strong>: An arid desert that can be explored once Pam's passenger bus has been fixed.</li></ul><h2>Characters</h2><p>Stardew Valley's residents are initially somewhat wary of the player as a new arrival.

Unlike most other voxel-based games, Cube World intentionally lacks <a href=\"/sandbox/3015-453/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-453\">sandbox</a>-style building and destruction elements, instead preferring to focus on traditional RPG mechanics such as exploration and combat.</p><p>The game features a character creation system with eight races and four combat classes (Mage, Ranger, Rogue, Warrior) to choose from. After creating a character, the player can play alone or with friends. The procedurally-generated world is populated with different environmental biomes, villages, dungeons, NPCs, and events. Players earn gear as they complete quests and explore dungeons, although earned gear is most useful in the region it is obtained in, with permanent upgrades instead coming from artifacts scattered throughout the world.</p><h2>Development Troubles</h2><p>Cube World began development in 2011, handled solely by Picroma, a software team comprised of Wolfram (Wollay) von Funck and his wife Sarah. Within a day of the game's alpha release, Cube World was removed from sale on Picroma's website, with Wollay citing server issues caused by launch demand and a supposed DDoS attack. The game briefly returned to sale on July 4, 2013, however it would be removed from sale again by August of the same year, citing more work to be done on the game in anticipation of future releases.</p><p>In the months following, Wollay continued to post semi-frequent updates about features and developments on the game, although no word was given on when the game would return for sale. As time continued and Wollay's updates became more sparse, before stopping entirely from mid-2017 to January 2019. Many had already begun questioning the development of the game and the likelihood of the game seeing a re-release, a sentiment which only solidified after Wollay's apparent disappearance in 2017.</p><p>On September 6, 2019, Wollay <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wol_lay/status/1170054041721815040\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">announced</a> on Twitter that the game would be releasing on Steam before the end of the year, with alpha owners receiving a free Steam key for the game. The game subsequently released on September 30, 2019, now labelled a beta version. The beta release saw a handful of bug fixes leading up to its launch, however no updates on bug fixes or new game features have been released since. Upon launch, many criticized the game's re-launch for lacking many features promised at the time of the game's alpha release, as well as the introduction of land-bound equipment significantly changing the game's progression system.</p>", "expected_release_day": null, "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": null, "guid": "3030-37398", "id": 37398, "image": {"icon_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/38/386689/3290929-header.jpg", "medium_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/38/386689/3290929-header.jpg", "screen_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/screen_medium/38/386689/3290929-header.jpg", "screen_large_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/screen_kubrick/38/386689/3290929-header.jpg", "small_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/38/386689/3290929-header.jpg", "super_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_large/38/386689/3290929-header.jpg", "thumb_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_avatar/38/386689/3290929-header.jpg", "tiny_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/square_mini/38/386689/3290929-header.jpg", "original_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3290929-header.jpg", "image_tags": "All Images,Box Art"}, "image_tags": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-37398/?filter=image_tag:All%20Images", "name": "All Images", "total": 299}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-37398/?filter=image_tag:Concept%20Art", "name": "Concept Art", "total": 6}, {"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/images/3030-37398/?filter=image_tag:Screenshots", "name": "Screenshots", "total": 281}], "name": "Cube World", "number_of_user_reviews": 0, "original_game_rating": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game_rating/3065-38/", "id": 38, "name": "OFLC: PG"}], "original_release_date": "2013-07-02", "platforms": [{"api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/platform/3045-94/", "id": 94, "name": "PC", "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/", "abbreviation": "PC"}], "site_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/cube-world/3030-37398/", "resource_type": "game"}, "Stardew Valley": {"aliases": null, "api_detail_url": "https://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-50899/", "date_added": "2015-09-16 22:01:39", "date_last_updated": "2019-03-14 13:01:11", "deck": "After escaping the burden of city life, an office worker begins their new life managing their grandfather's farmland in the rural region of Stardew Valley in this indie mix of top-down action-RPG and life simulation.", "description": "<h2>Overview</h2><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2837804-largefarm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2837804\" data-ratio=\"0.79666666666667\" data-width=\"1200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:79.7%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129563/2837804-largefarm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2837804\"><img alt=\"No Caption Provided\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2837804-largefarm.jpg\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/12/129563/2837804-largefarm.jpg 1200w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/12/129563/2837804-largefarm.jpg 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/12/129563/2837804-largefarm.jpg 480w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/12/129563/2837804-largefarm.jpg 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px\" data-width=\"320\"></a></figure><p>Stardew Valley is a top-down modern-fantasy life-simulation action-RPG created by <a href=\"/indie/3015-2911/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2911\">indie</a> developer <a href=\"/eric-barone/3040-74541/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-74541\">Eric Barone</a> (under the studio name <a href=\"/eric-barone/3010-12176/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-12176\">ConcernedApe</a>) and digitally published by <a href=\"/chucklefish-games/3010-8380/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-8380\">Chucklefish</a> for the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> on February 26, 2016.

Eventually the player can keep livestock, which are not slaughtered for their <a href=\"/meat/3055-267/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-267\">meat</a>, but instead generate animal products such as <a href=\"/egg/3055-607/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-607\">eggs</a> and <a href=\"/milk/3055-912/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-912\">milk</a>.</p><p>While the game's primary focus is farming, Stardew Valley also features <a href=\"/fishing/3015-510/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-510\">fishing</a>, <a href=\"/foraging/3015-4174/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4174\">foraging</a>, <a href=\"/mining/3015-1753/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1753\">mining</a>, a combat system and scripted social events. Players can customize their farm's layout, craft special items and decorations, and get to know the townsfolk personally through quests and <a href=\"/present/3055-1291/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1291\">gift</a>-giving. There are a total of ten romance options (five bachelors and five bachelorettes) and no restrictions regarding same-gender marriage.</p><p>The player can choose to try and revitalize Pelican Town's derelict <a href=\"/town-hall/3035-2892/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2892\">Community Center</a> to unlock various improvements for the town, or they can side with the mega-corporation Joja and pay cash to gain success. There is a local library/museum that accepts donations of artifacts and precious minerals, as well as a mouse merchant who sells unique hats that become available after unlocking specific Steam Achievements.</p><h3>New Game</h3><p>Stardew Valley features several <a href=\"/customizable-characters/3015-155/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-155\">character customization</a> options when beginning a new game, including gender, skin tone, hairstyle and clothing. Players can also choose their farm's name and their \"favorite thing,\" which is sometimes referenced in dialogue. Animal preference determines whether the player will later receive a cat or a dog as a farm pet.</p><p>New arrivals in Stardew Valley are greeted by Robin, the local <a href=\"/construction/3015-1090/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1090\">carpenter</a>. Robin escorts the player to their grandfather's farm, which has become completely overgrown after years of neglect. After meeting Mayor Lewis of nearby Pelican Town, the player is given a basic set of tools and a starter packet of Parsnip seeds with which to begin their new farming operation. Lewis also recommends that the player introduce themselves to the Valley's other residents as the new farmer. After the introductory sequence, gameplay is largely open-ended, allowing players to set their own goals and explore the world at their own pace.</p><h3>The Farm</h3><p>Players manage their farm plot in order to earn income from crops, animal produce and artisan goods. However, the land must first be cleared of obstructions such as trees, shrubs and rocks before any crops or structures can be created. The player's farm plot also contains their Farmhouse, which can be upgraded by bringing cash and raw materials to Robin. Players can sell items by placing them inside a convenient Shipping Box located near the Farmhouse; Mayor Lewis collects the contents of the box each night and sells them on behalf of the player at their standard prices.</p><p>Additional buildings can be constructed on the farm by Robin, such as <a href=\"/chicken-coop/3055-2725/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-2725\">chicken coops</a>, <a href=\"/barn/3035-2716/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-2716\">barns</a> and horse <a href=\"/stable/3035-3207/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3207\">stables</a>. Players can restore the destroyed Greenhouse on the northern edge of the farm by completing the Pantry quests in the Community Center, allowing any seeds planted inside to grow regardless of the current season.</p><p>After reaching 25,000G in total earnings, Demetrius offers to improve the cave behind the Greenhouse for free. He gives players the choice of installing a habitat for fruit bats, which generate random Fruit, or grow boxes for fungi which generate random Mushrooms.</p><p>Grandpa's Shrine can be found in the farm's northwest corner. Inspecting the Shrine reveals a letter asking the player to \"wait for my return at the dawn of the third year\".</p><h3>Tools</h3><p>Players rely on tools to shape their farm plot and gather certain resources. Several Tools can be upgraded by Clint at his <a href=\"/blacksmith/3015-4337/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4337\">blacksmith</a> shop, which increases their efficiency. Upon arriving in Stardew Valley, the player is given a set of five basic tools:</p><ul><li><strong>Hoe</strong>: The farmer's signature tool of the trade, Hoes are used to till soil. Once tilled, Fertilizer and Seeds can be planted on a soil tile.</li><li><a href=\"/scythe/3055-95/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-95\"><strong>Scythe</strong></a>: Nearly as ubiquitous as the Hoe, the curved Scythe slices tall grass and shrubs with ease. If a Silo has been constructed, cut grass will be automatically deposited as Hay for livestock feed.</li><li><a href=\"/axe/3055-437/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-437\"><strong>Axe</strong></a>: Standard trees and stumps are no match for the trusty Axe, but it must be upgraded to Copper-grade in order to chop tougher Hardwood logs.</li><li><a href=\"/pickaxe/3055-1934/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1934\"><strong>Pickaxe</strong></a>: Players can break stones and mine ore with the mighty Pickaxe. Upgraded picks can break larger stones.</li><li><a href=\"/watering-can/3055-1834/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-1834\"><strong>Watering Can</strong></a>: Plants need water to grow, and this humble vessel fills the role nicely.</li></ul><p>Four additional Tools can eventually be acquired through scripted events, quests or by purchasing them from the appropriate vendor.</p><ul><li><a href=\"/fishing-rod/3055-360/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-360\"><strong>Fishing Rod</strong></a>: A bounty of aquatic species can be snagged by skillful fishermen. Willy gifts a basic Bamboo Rod to the player in an early scripted event and will eventually sell better Rods for purchase.</li><li><strong>Milk Pail</strong>: Used to collect raw Milk from livestock.</li><li><strong>Shears</strong>: Wool can be harvested from Sheep with a sharp pair of Shears.</li><li><strong>Copper Pan</strong>: Once unlocked, players can use this to pan for mineral ore in streams.</li></ul><h3>Crops</h3><p>Seeds can be bought from Pierre's General Store or earned by completing Community Center quests. They can only be planted on soil tiles that have been tilled with a hoe; once planted, the crop must be watered daily to stimulate growth. Different crops require varying growth periods, and most crops can only be grown in certain seasons. Any planted crops with seasonal requirements will die at the beginning of the next non-viable season.</p><p>Various kinds of fertilizer can also be added to tilled soil prior to planting seeds. Each type of fertilizer grants a different beneficial effect, such as faster plant growth or higher-quality crops.</p><p>In addition to replanting common Acorns, Maple Seeds and Pine Cones to grow new trees on the Farm, several kinds of fruit tree saplings can also be purchased at Pierre's. Unlike standard crops, trees do not require watering and won't die following a seasonal change, making them viable long-term investments.</p><h3>Energy &amp; Health</h3><p>Using a hoe, wood axe, pickaxe, fishing rod or watering can consumes Energy, which is displayed as a <a href=\"/stamina-bar/3015-3569/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-3569\">bar</a> marked with the letter \"E\" in the lower-right corner. In addition to sleeping in the Farmhouse's bed, Energy can be restored with certain consumable items or by visiting Stardew Valley's local Spa.</p><p>Players that stay awake past 12:00 AM will receive a warning that \"it's getting late\". Going to sleep after midnight reduces the total amount of Energy recovered by the next morning. If the player does not reach their bed by 2:00 AM or uses up their entire Energy reserve, they will pass out on the spot from exhaustion. When this occurs, the player will awaken the next morning with only half of their total Energy restored and an invoice from Harvey for medical services rendered.</p><p>A Health meter appears next to the Energy bar while players are in the Mines or the Secret Woods. Like Energy, Health can be restored by sleeping, visiting the Spa or using consumables. If a player's health reaches zero, they will pass out and be woken up by one of the other villagers. Players that pass out due to health loss may randomly lose some of their inventory items, in addition to paying a heftier medical fee to Harvey.</p><h2>Points of Interest</h2><p>Stardew Valley is a lush and largely undeveloped region located in the Ferngill Republic. It contains the village of Pelican Town, as well as a number of other natural and artificial landmarks that can be discovered in the surrounding areas.</p><p>Certain characters refer to the ongoing <a href=\"/war/3015-479/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-479\">conflict</a> between the Ferngill Republic and the Gotoro Empire, an opposing nation located on the opposite side of the Gem Sea.</p><ul><li><strong>The Farm</strong>: The player's farm is located just west of Pelican Town. It is the only area in which players may plant and harvest crops, build structures and keep their livestock.</li><li><strong>Pelican Town</strong>: A quaint little village nestled in the heart of Stardew Valley. <ul><li><strong>Pierre's General Store</strong>: Pierre owns and operates a general store in the village square that sells a wide assortment of seeds, fertilizer, groceries and other sundries.</li><li><strong>Harvey's Clinic</strong>: A complete lack of <a href=\"/hospital/3035-1187/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1187\">hospitals</a> in Stardew Valley means that residents must rely on Harvey's modest clinic for medical services. Maru also works in the Clinic as Harvey's assistant on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</li><li><strong>The Stardrop Saloon</strong>: Pelican Town's <a href=\"/bar/3035-1999/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1999\">bar</a> is a popular hangout for locals. It is run by Gus, the friendly barkeep and chef.</li><li><strong>Museum</strong>: Stardew Valley's Museum features several exhibit displays that can be filled with donations such as precious minerals and other rare artifacts. Its sole staff member Gunther rewards repeat donors with unique gifts. The Museum also contains library bookshelves that hold any Books discovered by the player.</li><li><strong>Blacksmith</strong>: Clint runs Pelican Town's smithy and provides valuable services such as upgrading certain Tools and breaking open Geodes to reveal their mineral contents. He also sells several varieties of metal ore.</li><li><strong>Community Center</strong>: Pelican Town's disused Community Center is initially locked, but Mayor Lewis will unlock the door permanently in an early scripted event. After stepping inside, players will discover strange creatures called Junimos that refer to themselves as the \"keepers of the forest\". With some magical assistance from the Wizard, the player comes to understand the Junimos' language. They can choose to assist the friendly sprites in restoring the Community Center by completing \"Bundles\" consisting of specific items in exchange for rewards.</li><li><strong>JojaMart</strong>: A modern <a href=\"/supermarket/3035-1567/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-1567\">supermarket</a> owned by the powerful Joja Corporation. While convenient, JojaMart's presence has had a profoundly negative impact on Pelican Town's local economy. Morris, a loyal Joja representative, works tirelessly to attract new customers and expand Joja's presence in Stardew Valley. Shane also works at JojaMart, albeit with less enthusiasm than his manager Morris. If the player chooses to purchase a JojaMart Membership from Morris, this leads to the Community Center's acquisition by Joja Corporation, and the replacement of the old building with a new Joja Warehouse.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Cindersap Forest</strong>: A large wooded area to the south of the Farm offering a variety of foraging items and fish waiting to be harvested. A livestock farmer named Marnie sells animals raised on her farm, which sits on the northern edge of the forest. On Fridays and Sundays, a Traveling Cart arrives in the forest to sell unique goods. <ul><li><strong>Wizard's Tower</strong>: A reclusive Wizard practices magic in his Tower on the forest's western edge.</li><li><strong>Secret Woods</strong>: Players equipped with the Steel Axe can break a fallen log in the northwest corner to gain access to the Secret Woods, but they should be wary of the resident Slimes living there.</li><li><strong>Hat Shop</strong>: After unlocking at least one Achievement, a talking mouse moves into the abandoned house on the southern edge of Cindersap and opens a hat shop.</li><li><strong>Sewer</strong>: Raw sewage drips from a locked grate in the southeast corner of Cindersap, which can later be opened with Gunther's Rusty Key. The sewer tunnel also connects to a manhole in Pelican Town.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Pelican Beach</strong>: Ocean debris constantly washes onto the sandy southern coast of Stardew Valley, making this the destination for beach-combers. Willy owns a small Fishing Shop adjacent to the docks, where he sells bait, tackle and fishing rods.</li><li><strong>Carpenter's Shop</strong>: Located north of Pelican Town, Robin runs a workshop attached to her family's home. She can assist the player with building new structures on their Farm as well as upgrading existing ones, including the Farmhouse. Robin's services require both cash payment and a bundle of raw materials, particularly wood and stone. She can also demolish any unwanted buildings except the Farmhouse.</li><li><strong>Stardew Spa</strong>: Weary players can take a relaxing soak in the Spa's heated bathhouse to recover their Energy and Health. The path leading north from the Carpenter's Shop to the Spa is initially blocked, but an earthquake occurring early in the first Summer opens the way. A railroad track lies just behind the Spa; trains sometimes pass through the Valley on this rail line and occasionally drop valuable items for the player to retrieve.</li><li><strong>The Mines</strong>: A series of dark caverns filled with all manner of dangerous creatures. Bold players can delve into the Mines in search of valuable mineral ore and other treasures, provided that they can defend themselves from the bloodthirsty monsters who lurk inside.</li><li><strong>Adventurer's Guild</strong>: Conveniently located just to the east of the entrance to the Mines, veteran adventurer Marlon sells new armor and weapons inside the Adventurer's Guild hall. Marlon allows players to join his Guild after they have defeated ten Slimes.</li><li><strong>Quarry</strong>: Further east past the Adventurer's Guild lies a large Quarry which periodically generates stone and mineral ores. However, the bridge leading to the Quarry has collapsed and must be repaired first.</li><li><strong>Calico Desert</strong>: An arid desert that can be explored once Pam's passenger bus has been fixed.</li></ul><h2>Characters</h2><p>Stardew Valley's residents are initially somewhat wary of the player as a new arrival. Players can give gifts to most villagers to increase their affection, which is represented in the game's pause menu by a row of ten Hearts next to the villager's face. Twelve of the villagers can be pursued <a href=\"/romance/3015-253/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-253\">romantically</a> and can eventually <a href=\"/marriage/3015-2422/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2422\">marry</a> the player.</p><h3>Bachelors</h3><ul><li>Alex</li><li>Elliott</li><li>Harvey</li><li>Sam</li><li>Sebastian</li><li>Shane (Patch 1.1)</li></ul><h3>Bachelorettes</h3><ul><li>Abigail</li><li>Haley</li><li>Leah</li><li>Maru</li><li>Penny</li><li>Emily (Patch 1.1)</li></ul><h3>Non-Romanceable NPCs</h3><ul><li>Caroline</li><li>Clint</li><li>Demetrius</li><li>Dwarf</li><li>Evelyn</li><li>George</li><li>Gus</li><li>Jas</li><li>Jodi</li><li>Kent</li><li>Krobus</li><li>Lewis</li><li>Linus</li><li>Marnie</li><li>Pam</li><li>Pierre</li><li>Robin</li><li>Sandy</li><li>Vincent</li><li>Willy</li><li>Wizard</li></ul><h3>Non-Social NPCs</h3><ul><li>Bouncer</li><li>Gil</li><li>Governor</li><li>Grandpa</li><li>Gunther</li><li>Marlon</li><li>Morris</li><li>Mr. Qi</li></ul><h2>Patch 1.1</h2><p>According to ConcernedApe on the <a href=\"http://stardewvalley.net/post-launch-progress-update-version-1-1-and-more/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Stardew Valley's forums</a>, patch 1.1 would include the following fixes and added content:</p><ul><li>More late-game content</li><li>New farm buildings</li><li>New crops</li><li>New artisan goods</li><li>New advanced farming/producing mechanics</li><li>Shane and Emily will be marriage candidates.

2D <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/indie/3015-2911/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2911\">indie</a> fantasy action-adventure <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/open-world/3015-207/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-207\">open world</a> platformer developed and published digitally by <a href=\"/re-logic/3010-7603/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-7603\">Re-Logic</a> for the <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> (via <a href=\"/steam/3015-718/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-718\">Steam</a>) on May 16, 2011. Along with numerous updates, it was ported to a variety of platforms throughout the years.</p><p>Originally built in five months with the XNA Framework by a small team (led by <a href=\"/andrew-spinks/3040-100113/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-100113\">Andrew \"Redigit\" Spinks</a>, best known for his <a href=\"/super-mario-bros/3025-1899/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1899\"><em>Super Mario Bros. X</em></a> fangame), Terraria is a 2D platformer with elements of <a href=\"/minecraft/3030-30475/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-30475\">Minecraft</a>, putting emphasis on exploration, <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/mining/3015-1753/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1753\">mining</a>, <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/crafting/3015-934/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-934\">crafting</a>, and combat with hostile creatures in a <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/procedural-generation/3015-328/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-328\">procedurally-generated</a> <a href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/sandbox/3015-453/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-453\">sandbox</a> environment. As players earn their footing by crafting better equipment, they progress through the game by defeating <a href=\"/bosses/3015-229/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-229\">bosses</a> found throughout the world (one of which makes the entire game harder while unlocking new ores for better equipment and new biomes to explore).</p><p>Along with numerous updates over the years (enhancing the world generation system and light rendering while adding a large variety of new monsters, items, and gameplay mechanics), the game was released DRM-free on other digital storefronts (including <a href=\"/gogcom/3015-2379/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2379\">GOG.com</a> and the Humble Store) on October 2, 2014 and was made compatible with <a href=\"/mac/3045-17/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-17\">Mac</a> and <a href=\"/linux/3045-152/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-152\">Linux</a> systems on August 12, 2015.</p><p>The game was also ported by <a href=\"/engine-software-bv/3010-1704/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-1704\">Engine Software</a> to numerous seventh- and eighth-generation consoles (including the <a href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-35\">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a> starting in early 2013, the <a href=\"/playstation-vita/3045-129/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-129\">PlayStation Vita</a> starting in late 2013, the <a href=\"/playstation-4/3045-146/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-146\">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a> starting in late 2014, the <a href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-117\">Nintendo 3DS</a> starting in late 2015, and the <a href=\"/wii-u/3045-139/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-139\">Wii U</a> starting in mid-2016) and by <a href=\"/codeglue/3010-6668/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-6668\">Codeglue</a> to numerous <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iOS</a>, <a href=\"/android/3045-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-123\">Android</a>, and <a href=\"/windows-phone/3045-124/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-124\">Windows 10 Phone</a> devices (starting between late 2013 and late 2014). These ports were released both digitally and in retail by <a href=\"/505-games/3010-277/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-277\">505 Games</a> (in North America and Europe) and <a href=\"/spike-chunsoft/3010-8152/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-8152\">Spike Chunsoft</a> (in Japan, with the exception of the 360 and XONE versions). The 360 and PS3 versions were also released in a <a href=\"/collectors-edition/3015-1521/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1521\">Collector's Edition</a>, featuring a USB memory stick (resembling the game's pickaxe).</p><p>A spin-off to the game, titled <a href=\"/terraria-otherworld/3030-48857/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-48857\">Terraria: Otherworld</a>, was in development by Re-Logic alongside <a href=\"/pipeworks-studio/3010-11846/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-11846\">Pipeworks Studio</a> (who took over after Engine Software left the project). Set in an alternate dimension within the Terraria universe, players would have had to restore a once-pristine world from a never-ending wave of \"corruption\". In April 2018, it was announced that development on Otherworld had been cancelled.</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><p>Terraria invites the player to explore or dig for building materials, while also continually spawning monsters off-screen. The game challenges the player to immediately start to come up with solutions to questions of shelter, housing, protection, fast travel and ultimately aesthetics and automation. Different armors, weapons, equipment and access to NPCs and Bosses add RPG like progression and enable the player to seek out increasingly difficult depths and environments. Player characters can travel between different offline worlds and online servers, thus making all resources infinite, encouraging heedless creativity, rather than economical resource management.</p><p>The worlds in Terraria are <a href=\"../../randomly-generated-maps/92-206/\" rel=\"nofollow \">randomly generated</a> based on the size of the world selected by the player, with several defined Biomes:</p><ul><li>Forest</li><li>Snow Biome</li><li>Underground Layer</li><li>Cavern Layer</li><li>The Underworld</li><li>Corruption</li><li>Jungle and Underground Jungle</li><li>Dungeon</li><li>Ocean</li><li>Desert</li><li>Floating Islands</li><li>Space</li><li>The Hallow and Underground Hallow (late game)</li><li>Meteorite</li><li>The Crimson (an alternative to The Corruption released in v1.2)</li></ul><p>Each zone spawns a specific set of monsters, treasure, ore, and/or plants. For examples, glowing mushroom biomes will have large mushrooms instead of trees, <a href=\"http://wiki.terrariaonline.com/The_Corruption\" rel=\"nofollow \">The Corruption</a> has dark, corrupted versions of normal enemies, and Hell is filled with lava and demons.</p><p>Water and lava exhibit dynamic properties, and the creeping growth of plants, crystals, and even corruption and hallow mean the world is constantly shifting, almost beyond the player's ability to control i. There is also one <a href=\"../../randomly-generated-dungeons/92-167/\" rel=\"nofollow \">randomly generated dungeon</a> per world for the player to explore. Pots and <a href=\"../../treasure-chest/93-517/\" rel=\"nofollow \">treasure chests</a> will be randomly placed for players to find valuable accessories to equip with game-altering affects, such as a \"Red Baloon\" that increases jump height, or \"Hermes Boots\" that improve run speed.</p><h3>Crafting and Building</h3><p>Buildings and items are created using materials the players gather themselves from the world. Trees can be chopped down and replanted, and various types of dirt and ore can be gathered. Some <a href=\"../../crafting/92-934/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Crafting</a> stations are created by placing objects on or near each other (For example, placing flasks on a table makes an <a href=\"../../alchemy/92-1233/\" rel=\"nofollow \">Alchemy</a> station) while others such as Furnaces are crafted from other items and then placed on a flat surface</p><p>While a number of certain items (such as crafting tables, platforms, torches, some types of ammo, and more) can be crafted by hand, most require a crafting station to use. The types of crafting station are as follows:</p><ul><li>The workbench allows the player to create basic objects and miscellaneous objects such as walls and basic tools.</li><li>The Sawmill allows for the creation of higher grade wooden objects, primarily wooden furniture.</li><li>The Loom allows for the crafting of silks and vanity items.</li><li>The Furnace allows the player to craft ore into bars. Later upgrades allow processing endgame ores such as hellstone.</li><li>The Anvil allows the player to craft metal bars into tools, armor, and more. Later upgrades allow creating endgame items.</li><li>The Alchemy Table is used to create potions, with a 33% chance to not consume ingredients.</li><li>Various specialized crafting stations allow for crafting specific sets of items, or are used to craft a small number of items.</li></ul><h3>Player Advancement</h3><p>Players have no improvable stats beyond health and mana. Health increases by finding and breaking open underground Heart Containers with a pickaxe, dropping a Life Crystal item which allows for a permanant 20-point HP increase, up to a cap of 400 HP. After the player has killed the Plantera boss in a world, life fruit will spawn in the Jungle, increasing the maximum HP cap to 500 HP. Mana is increased by collecting 10 falling stars (which only appear at night), and combining them into a Mana Star, which increases maximum mana by 20 points (maximum mana caps out at 200 before accessory modifications).</p><p>Beyond those two stats, player advancement is accomplished by improving their equipment and accessories via exploration, discovery of chests, and destruction of monsters and bosses.</p><h3>NPCs</h3><p>NPCs are attracted to player-built structures based on certain conditions met by the players in the game. The NPCs are attracted by closed off rooms or \"houses\" that they can each claim as their own and can be assigned to different rooms via the housing interface. For example if all players have 50 silver, a merchant will appear. If a player has more than the default starting health, a nurse will appear.</p><p>The basic criteria for a \"house\" are:</p><ul><li>Side and back wall, floor, and ceiling. Back wall made out of something other than dirt or dungeon brick.</li><li>Must have a table/workbench and a chair.</li><li>Must have an exit, either a wood platform in the floor or ceiling or a door.</li><li>Must have a light source.</li><li>Must be at least 8 blocks wide and 4 blocks tall.</li></ul><p>As of 1.4.0.1, NPCs have a happiness mechanic, tied to various conditions of their house. Being too close to too many other NPCs, living in a biome they like or dislike, or living near another NPC they like or dislike will all impact their happiness, causing their prices to fluctuate accordingly.</p><p>There are 29 total NPCs in the game, however only 26 of them can become permanent residents of a world. Before entering hardmode, the NPCs that can move into a world are the <a href=\"/the-guide/3005-20766/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20766\">Guide</a> (who is present from the start of a new world), <a href=\"/the-merchant/3005-20768/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20768\">Merchant</a>, <a href=\"/the-nurse/3005-20777/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20777\">Nurse</a>, <a href=\"/the-demolitionist/3005-20778/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20778\">Demolitionist</a>, Dye Trader, Angler, Zoologist, <a href=\"/the-dryad/3005-20780/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20780\">Dryad</a>, Painter, Golfer, <a href=\"/the-arms-dealer/3005-20779/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20779\">Arms Dealer</a>, Tavernkeep, Stylist, Goblin Tinkerer, Witch Doctor, <a href=\"/the-clothier/3005-20805/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-20805\">Clothier</a>, Mechanic, and Party Girl. In hardmode, they are joined by the Wizard, Tax Collector, Truffle, Pirate, Steampunker, Cyborg, Santa Claus, and the Princess. As well, the Zoologist sells pet licenses, which allow three pet NPCs (a cat, a dog, and a rabbit) to live with a chosen NPC, improving nearby NPC happiness.</p><p>The NPCs which can not permanently move in to a house are the Old Man (who becomes the Clothier upon Skeletron's defeat), and the Skeleton Merchant and the Traveling Merchant (both of whom spawn randomly at the beginning of each day, and disappear at the end of each day.)</p><h2>Multiplayer</h2><p>The game is designed with multiplayer in mind, so players can start a server and invite friends. The player character can be used in any of the player's worlds, and online servers as well. When starting a server, it can be hosted on any world. This can save a lot of repetition of advancing a character or world when wanting to play with friends. Flags exist for Player versus Player game modes, with choices of team color to set player damage. Certain items exist with player/terrain damage in mind, such as thrown grenades that only hurt players and bombs that damage both players and terrain.</p><h2>Updates</h2><p>Terraria has received over fifty updates since release.

It was originally released in a <a href=\"/pre-release-public-testing/3015-7541/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7541\">pre-alpha</a> state via the TIGSource forums on May 17, 2009, and was later hosted online for <a href=\"/browser/3045-140/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-140\">supported browsers</a> before receiving a standalone release for <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a>, <a href=\"/mac/3045-17/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-17\">Mac</a>, and <a href=\"/linux/3045-152/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-152\">Linux</a> on June 30, 2010. The game would officially exit its Beta version on November 18, 2011, although major updates continue to be released. Since August 2011, a number of ports of the game have released for consoles and mobile devices.</p><p>Presented with a unique low-resolution <a href=\"/voxel/3015-1887/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1887\">\"voxel\"</a> aesthetic (where everything is shaped using cubes), the game allows players to interact with a variety of different \"blocks\" in a <a href=\"/randomly-generated-dungeons/3015-167/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-167\">procedurally-generated</a> world. Along with both <a href=\"/resource-gathering/3015-975/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-975\">resource mining/gathering</a> and <a href=\"/crafting/3015-934/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-934\">item crafting</a> (hence the game name), the game features exploration (with multiple biomes and locations), combat, and construction. In addition to the standard \"Survival\" mode, the game features a \"Creative\" mode that allows players to design environments with an unlimited amount of blocks at their disposal and no survival elements. The game supports <a href=\"/online/3015-559/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-559\">online multiplayer</a> and later supported numerous content packs (including new world/block textures and player skins, many of which are <a href=\"/crossover/3015-732/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-732\">cross-promotions</a> with other games and franchises).</p><p>Originally created by indie developer <a href=\"/markus-persson/3040-97855/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-97855\">Markus \"Notch\" Persson</a> (whose roles were later taken over by fellow indie developer <a href=\"/jens-bergensten/3040-99838/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-99838\">Jens \"Jeb\" Bergensten</a>), Minecraft was ported to numerous smartphones (originally known as <em>Minecraft: Pocket Edition</em>) and consoles (originally known as <em>Minecraft: Console Edition</em>, with the \"Console\" in the name being replaced by the console's name). On September 20, 2017, the game received a major \"Better Together\" update that merges the smartphone version with some console versions (including Windows 10, <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a>, and later <a href=\"/nintendo-switch/3045-157/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-157\">Nintendo Switch</a>) together for a single multi-platform version (known as <em>Minecraft: Bedrock Edition</em>, with the original computer versions renamed to <em>Minecraft: Java Edition</em>) with all features accessible (including <a href=\"/cross-platform-multiplayer/3015-4183/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4183\">cross-platform multiplayer</a>). Alternate editions include a multi-platform version for use in classroom settings (<em>Minecraft: Education Edition</em>), a cut-down version for small <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Raspberry Pi</a> microcomputers (<em>Minecraft: Pi Edition</em>), and a multi-platform version for use in <a href=\"/china/3035-343/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-343\">China</a> (<em>Minecraft China</em>).</p><p>The game has received a number of <a href=\"/spin-off/3015-1100/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1100\">spin-offs</a>, including the 2015 adventure game <a href=\"/minecraft-story-mode/3030-48413/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-48413\">Minecraft: Story Mode</a> (and <a href=\"/minecraft-story-mode-season-2/3030-59826/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-59826\">its 2017 sequel</a>), the 2020 dungeon crawler <a href=\"/minecraft-dungeons/3030-70421/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-70421\">Minecraft: Dungeons</a>, and the augmented-reality mobile game <a href=\"/minecraft-earth/3030-73461/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-73461\">Minecraft Earth</a>. As well, Minecraft's procedurally-generated sandbox elements would inspire many other games, in both 2D (such as <a href=\"/terraria/3030-34940/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-34940\">Terraria</a> and <a href=\"/starbound/3030-37839/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-37839\">Starbound</a>) and 3D (such as <a href=\"/dragon-quest-builders/3030-50284/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-50284\">Dragon Quest Builders</a> and <a href=\"/lego-worlds/3030-49820/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-49820\">LEGO Worlds</a>).</p><h2>Versions</h2><h3>Original / Java Edition</h3><p>The original version of Minecraft, developed using a custom engine in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Java</a>, had three major pre-release phases: pre-Alpha (including Classic, Indev, and Infdev), Alpha, and Beta. Almost every version of the Java Edition can be played in the final release via the launcher, including some versions originally not released to the public.</p><ul><li><strong>Classic:</strong> The first of the pre-Alpha versions, Classic versions were first released for free for supported browsers on May 17, 2009, lasting until November 10, 2009. These versions originally lacked survival elements (instead being a primitive version of the modern \"Creative\" game mode), and had a restricted, randomly-generated environment (surrounded by endless ocean). Online multiplayer was added on May 31, 2009, and an alternate single-player version with basic survival elements (such as enemy mobs, a health system, and a basic bow-and-arrow system) was added on September 1, 2009.</li><li><strong>Indev:</strong> Short for \"In-development\", indev was the second phase of the pre-Alpha versions, beginning on December 23, 2009 and lasting until February 23, 2010. Indev focused on the \"survival\" version of the game introduced in Classic, and added a new dynamic lighting system, crafting and inventory systems, optional map themes, specialized tools and weapons, a day-night cycle, and farming.</li><li><strong>Infdev:</strong> Short for \"Infinite Development\", infdev was the final of the pre-Alpha versions, beginning on February 27, 2010 and lasting until June 30, 2010. The name infdev was chosen as these versions revamped the terrain generator, allowing for \"infinite\" procedurally-generated terrain. In addition, this version adds more craftable items (including signs, ladders, doors, and minecarts) and more complex cave systems (including special dungeons).</li><li><strong>Alpha:</strong> Beginning on June 30, 2010 and lasting until December 3, 2010, the alpha versions were the first version to allow (and require) a paid, standalone launcher to play, rather than being playable for free in-browser. These versions added biomes, redstone circuitry, improved A.I. pathfinding, new block types (including stairs), and a new dimension (<a href=\"/the-nether/3035-3392/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-3392\">The Nether</a>), alongside reintroducing online multiplayer. Most updates in this time were added as \"Seecret Friday\" updates, which intentionally left the changelog empty to let players find out what's changed.</li><li><strong>Beta:</strong> Beginning on December 20, 2010 and ending on November 11, 2011, the beta versions added numerous block and mob types (including beds and tame-able wolves), revamped the inventory system (making it easier to control and more difficult to cheat items in), and added weather effects and achievements. One of the last major updates (also called the \"Adventure Update\", released on September 14, 2011), revamped the game's biome generation while adding new combat mechanics (such as <a href=\"/critical-hit/3015-97/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-97\">critical hits</a>), an <a href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-39\">experience system</a>, a <a href=\"/hunger/3015-677/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-677\">hunger system</a>, <a href=\"/sprinting/3015-603/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-603\">sprinting</a>, and new pre-generated structures (such as villages). The Adventure Update also introduced a new Creative Mode, based loosely upon the original Classic verion of the game, albeit with a variety of new features.</li><li><strong>Full Release:</strong> Starting on November 18, 2011 with the 1.0.0 version of the game, the full release of Minecraft introduced an ending, including a new dimension (<a href=\"/the-end/3035-4100/\" data-ref-id=\"3035-4100\">The End</a>), a final boss (the <a href=\"/ender-dragon/3005-23814/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-23814\">Ender Dragon</a>), and a credits sequence. Updates since version 1.0.0 have added another boss (the <a href=\"/wither/3015-7579/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7579\">Wither</a>), rebalanced the combat system, greatly expanded the vertical build limit, overhauled cave generation, and added two new types of ore (netherite and copper). Starting with version 1.12.2, this version of Minecraft is known as <em>Minecraft: Java Edition</em>, to differentiate it from the multi-platform <em>Minecraft: Bedrock Edition</em>.</li></ul><p>A restricted-use demo version was first released in June 2011, bundled with that month's copy of PC Gamer Magazine. The PC Gamer demo used a pre-set world, would reset after five in-game days (roughly 100 real-time minutes), and used the Beta 1.3 version of the game (although more recent versions existed at the time). On August 1, 2012, versions of Minecraft after Full Release 1.3.1 would begin a similarly limited demo for users not logged into an account.</p><p>On May 7, 2019, an early version of the game (0.0.23a_01) was re-made using a custom engine in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">JavaScript</a> for <a href=\"/browser/3045-140/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-140\">supported browsers</a>, in celebration of the game's 10th anniversary of development. Titled <em>Minecraft Classic</em>, it was released for free and can be found <a href=\"https://classic.minecraft.net\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">here</a>.</p><h3>Bedrock / Pocket Edition</h3><p>The first official ports of the game were released for smartphones as <em>Minecraft: Pocket Edition</em>. Developed in-house by Mojang (with a game engine re-written from the ground up in C++), certain aspects of the game were revised for <a href=\"/touch-controls/3015-2256/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-2256\">touchscreen gameplay</a>. It received numerous <a href=\"/pre-release-public-testing/3015-7541/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-7541\">public pre-release revisions</a> from August 16, 2011 to its official release on December 19, 2016.</p><ul><li>The <a href=\"/android/3045-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-123\">Android</a> version was the first version released to the public, originally as an exclusive to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xperia_Play\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Xperia PLAY</a> smartphone on August 16, 2011. It was then made available to other devices on October 8, 2011.

A special version for <a href=\"/samsung-gear-vr-support/3015-8745/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-8745\">Samsung Gear VR</a> headsets, known as <em>Minecraft: Gear VR Edition</em>, was released on April 27, 2016.</li></ul><ul><li>The <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iOS</a> version was released on November 17, 2011.

It was also released for Windows 10 Mobile on February 22, 2017.</li></ul><ul><li>The <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">Windows 10</a> version, known as <em>Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition</em>, was digitally released by <a href=\"/xbox-game-studios/3010-340/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-340\">Microsoft</a> via the Microsoft Store on July 29, 2015. This version later supported <a href=\"/virtual-reality/3015-421/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-421\">virtual reality</a> through the <a href=\"/oculus-rift/3000-41/\" data-ref-id=\"3000-41\">Oculus Rift</a> (when downloaded from the Oculus Store).</li></ul><p>Along with post-release updates, the game received a multi-platform re-release on September 20, 2017, simply known as <em>Minecraft</em>. Known out-of-game as the \"Bedrock\" version, the Android, iOS, and Windows 10 versions use a unified codebase and support <a href=\"/cross-platform-multiplayer/3015-4183/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-4183\">cross-platform multiplayer</a>. In addition, three console ports were re-released with this new codebase (also with cross-platform multiplayer support):</p><ul><li>The <a href=\"/xbox-one/3045-145/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-145\">Xbox One</a> version, which was released digitally by Microsoft on September 20, 2017.

As of December 10, 2019, all \"Console Edition\" versions of the game are deprecated and not in active development.</p><p>The game engine used for these versions were re-written from the ground up in C++ and has numerous changes, including split-screen multiplayer functionality, an automatic crafting system, a more limited world size (which was improved with later console releases), player skins as <a href=\"/downloadable-content/3015-329/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-329\">downloadable content</a>, and bonus game modes.</p><p>Some versions of the game were re-released as a multi-platform game (also known as the \"Bedrock Edition\").

This version is discontinued, with its last update on June 21, 2018.</li></ul><h3>Special Editions</h3><h4>Minecraft 4k</h4><p>Developed in 2010 as part of the yearly \"Java 4K\" programming contest, Minecraft 4k was a programming exercise attempting to fit Minecraft into four kilobytes of code. The game's environment is almost entirely randomly generated, no mobs exist in the environment, the world is 64x64x63 blocks in size, and the player can only destroy blocks and place dirt blocks.</p><h4>Minecraft: Pi Edition</h4><p>Minecraft: Pi Edition is a free version of Pocket Edition developed for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Raspberry Pi</a> series of microcomputers (running <a href=\"/linux/3045-152/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-152\">Linux</a>-based <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspbian\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Raspbian OS</a>) on February 11, 2013. It was later included by default in installations of the Raspbian OS.</p><p>Despite its abandonment (as there have been no updates) and simplicity (with a cut-down version of Creative mode), this version is used as an educational tool for programmers, as it supports multiple programming languages for scripting.</p><h4>Minecraft: Education Edition</h4><p>Minecraft: Education Edition is a special variant of the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">Windows 10</a> version for use in classroom teaching. Released on November 1, 2016 for eligible institutions (including schools, public libraries, and public museums), Education Edition allows educators to build lesson plans by restricting building/exploration, creating NPCs, spectating all students, and allowing students to document using screenshots (using unique Camera and Portfolio items).</p><p>It was later released to <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iOS</a> on September 6, 2018.</p><h4>Minecraft China</h4><p>Minecraft China is a localized variant of the original \"Java Edition\" version of the game, released by <a href=\"/netease/3010-9597/\" data-ref-id=\"3010-9597\">NetEase</a> for the <a href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-94\">PC</a> on August 8, 2017. It was released as a freemium download with some altered functionality (relying on a new launcher created by NetEase and requiring a NetEase account).</p><p>Special Minecraft China variants of the <a href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-96\">iOS</a> and <a href=\"/android/3045-123/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-123\">Android</a> versions were released shortly after (September 5, 2017 for iOS and October 12, 2017 for Android).</p><h2>Gameplay</h2><h3>Game Modes</h3><p>Minecraft has two primary game modes: Survival and Creative. Once selected, game mode can only be changed via console commands.</p><p>In addition, server owners for some versions of the game can enable special <a href=\"/player-vs-player/3015-346/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-346\">player-vs-player</a> multiplayer minigames using custom maps.</p><h4>Survival</h4><p>Survival Mode is the base game mode of Minecraft, starting players empty in an open <a href=\"/randomly-generated-maps/3015-206/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-206\">procedurally-generated</a> world. Players must explore the world, collect resources, upgrade their gear, battle hostile mobs, and manage both their health and their <a href=\"/hunger/3015-677/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-677\">hunger</a>.</p><p>The game has no <a href=\"/never-ending/3015-1467/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-1467\">pre-determined goals</a> outside of fighting the Ender Dragon, however players can work on the game's <a href=\"/achievements/3015-29/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-29\">achievements and advancements</a>, and can build new structures to their heart's content.</p><p>While playing Survival Mode, players can choose from four difficulty levels for their world:</p><ul><li><strong>Peaceful</strong> - Hostile and potentially-hostile mobs cannot spawn naturally. Changing to this difficulty from others removes all hostile and potentially-hostile mobs from the world. Health and hunger gradually replenish on this difficulty.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Easy</strong> - Hostile mobs and potentially-hostile mobs can now spawn, although they deal reduced damage and most <a href=\"/damage-over-time/3015-370/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-370\">damage-over-time</a> effects aren't present. Additionally, zombies can't turn villagers into zombie villagers. When the hunger meter is fully depleted, the player's health begins to drain down until it reaches 50%.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Normal</strong> - Hostile mobs and explosions now deal standard damage to players. When the hunger meter is fully depleted, the player's health begins to drain down until it reaches 5%. Certain hostile mobs now have additional attacks. Villagers killed by Zombies have a 50% chance of becoming a Zombie.</li></ul><ul><li><strong>Hard</strong> - Hostile mobs and explosions now deal even greater damage to players. When the hunger meter is fully depleted, the player's health begins to drain down to 0% (causing them to die from starvation). Certain mobs are now more likely to spawn with weapons and armor. Zombies can now break down doors and spawn reinforcements, and villagers killed by zombies now always become zombie villagers.</li></ul><p>In addition, the Java Edition has a bonus <strong>Hardcore</strong> game mode, which locks the difficulty to Hard while disabling the Bonus Chest, cheat commands, and <a href=\"/permanent-death/3015-431/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-431\">the ability to respawn</a> after death (only allowing dead players to spectate the world).</p><h4>Creative</h4><p>Creative Mode allows players to build structures freely with no resource or inventory management, no crafting, no combat, and no health or hunger management. Players have an alternate inventory that allows them an infinite selection of almost all blocks and items in the game. They can also toggle <a href=\"/flight/3015-350/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-350\">the ability to fly around freely</a> by double-jumping.</p><h3>Starting Out</h3><p>When creating a new game in Minecraft, a world is generated and the player is spawned at a random spot. That spot is the player's spawn point, as well as the permanent world spawn point (however players can change their spawn point by sleeping in a bed). As the player moves around, the world will generate in 16x16 segments of blocks, known as chunks. The world is created of same-sized blocks, most commonly dirt, sand, and stone. Everything in Minecraft revolves around obtaining these blocks, placing them in the world, and crafting them into useful items.</p><p>To collect blocks, the player left-clicks on a block and cracks will appear in it. If they continue to left-click until the cracks fill the block, the block will shatter dropping a miniature version of itself (or a particular material depending on the block type). The time it takes to collect a block depends on the block the player is collecting and the tool (if any) that they are using. Most mineral-based blocks will require the proper tool to be harvested (stone will not yield cobblestone unless mined with a pick, snow tiles will not yield snowballs unless harvested with a shovel, etc.). Once collected, initial blocks will be placed into the player's hotbar (from left to right), with spillover collecting into the rest of the player's inventory. To place a block, equip it in the hotbar (with either the mouse wheel or corresponding number key) and right-click on another block. [NOTE: Some blocks when collected will yield an item instead of a block (such as diamond or coal) this item cannot be placed and right-click will do nothing.] Take care when using tools as using the incorrect tool on a specific block type will waste two uses of the tool instead of just one (for instance, using a pickaxe on a tree).</p><p>Collecting blocks is only the first part of playing Minecraft, then comes crafting, which is more important. In the inventory screen (Default hotkey: E) there is a 2x2 square grid used for crafting. To craft an item, the player must place the correct ingredients in the correct shape in the grid. Some items can be created with very simple diagrams (i.e. a single block of wood will create four wooden planks), while others can be very complicated. One very important early game craft is to create a workbench (which allows players to craft in a 3x3 square allowing them to create more advanced items). A workbench is created with four planks; one placed in each spot of the 2x2 grid.</p><p>Once players have crafted a workbench, the next step is crafting tools like shovels and axes. These allow players to gather blocks more quickly and collect more advanced blocks. After a player makes tools the rest of the game is up to them. Players can mine for rare ore, build elaborate structures and much more.</p><h3>Weather</h3><p>As of Beta version 1.5, Minecraft has weather in the form of rain, snow and thunderstorms. Rain will occur, if rarely, in all biomes except desert, tundra and taiga, and snow will only fall in the tundra and taiga biomes, or at a certain altitude. Instances of both of these weather effects will last approximately 15 minutes, and thunderstorms may occur during either. During thunderstorms the world becomes darker, enough so that enemy mobs may spawn even during the dau, and lightning strikes setting fire to the block it hits. Snow fall will cover most blocks in snow and cause water to freeze and become blocks of ice.</p><h3>Recipe Book</h3><p>Added in Full Release version 1.12, the recipe book stores any crafting recipes that the player has learned, allowing for quick reference in the future. Recipes are learned upon meeting pre-determined conditions, such as picking up certain items involved in the recipe, or through crafting a previously unlearned recipe.</p><h2>Items</h2><p>While there are a considerable number of items in Minecraft, they can largely be split into a number of categories, listed below:</p><h3>Tools</h3><p>Tools are used to perform specific tasks. Certain tools (the shovel, pickaxe, axe, and hoe) can be built out of different materials (wood, stone, iron, gold, diamond, and netherite).</p><table><thead><tr><th>Tool Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Shovel</td><td>Shovels are used to harvest \"soft\" blocks, such as dirt, gravel, clay, and sand. They are also the only tools which can harvest snowballs from snow.</td></tr><tr><td>Pickaxe</td><td>Pickaxes are used to harvest stone, ores and other \"hard\" blocks. No other tool can yield drops from any of these blocks.</td></tr><tr><td>Axe</td><td>Axes are used for harvesting wood, and also double as a slow yet powerful weapon.</td></tr><tr><td>Hoe</td><td>Hoes are used for tilling soil into farmland.</td></tr><tr><td>Flint and Steel</td><td>Flint and Steel is used to set other blocks on fire.</td></tr><tr><td>Bucket</td><td>Buckets are used to hold water, lava, milk, snow, and fish. Contents of a bucket can usually be placed by right-clicking.</td></tr><tr><td>Compass</td><td>The Compass points towards the player's spawn point, unless in the Nether, in which case it goes berserk.</td></tr><tr><td>Fishing Rod</td><td>The Fishing Rod is used to catch fish from bodies of water, as well as to pull land mobs toward the player.</td></tr><tr><td>Clock</td><td>The Clock gives a general indication of the time of day.</td></tr><tr><td>Map</td><td>The map gives an overview of a large area, although the player must uncover it from <a href=\"/fog-of-war/3015-14/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-14\">fog of war</a>.</td></tr><tr><td>Shears</td><td>Shears are used to collect delicate items like wool, leaves, and cobwebs. As well, they can be used to carve pumpkins for crafting jack o'lanterns.</td></tr><tr><td>Fire Charge</td><td>Used in a similar fashion to flint and steel. Can also be weaponized by firing out of dispensers.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Items built of different materials have varying durabilities. Durability denotes the number of times an item can be used before it breaks and must be replaced. Gold is 33, wood is 60, stone is 132, iron is 251, diamond is 1562, and netherite is 2031. Gold, however, harvests standard blocks slightly faster than all other tools, including netherite. Durability of items with only one material type varies depending on the item.</p><h4>Armor</h4><p>Armor reduces damage taken from physical attacks by enemy mobs.</p><p>With the exceptions of helmets and elytra, every type of armor can be made from the following materials: leather, gold, chainmail, iron, diamond, and netherite. Helmets can be crafted from each of these materials, as well as a sixth material: turtle shell. Elytra can not be crafted and have no associated material.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Helmet</td><td>Helmets are worn over the player's head. They provide approximately 15% of a full set of armor's damage reduction.</td></tr><tr><td>Chestplate</td><td>Chestplates are worn over the player's torso. They provide approximately 40% of a full set of armor's damage reduction.</td></tr><tr><td>Leggings</td><td>Leggings are worn over the player's legs. They provide approximately 30% of a full set of armor's damage reduction.</td></tr><tr><td>Boots</td><td>Boots are worn over the player's feet. They provide approximately 15% of a full set of armor's damage reduction.</td></tr><tr><td>Elytra</td><td>A special kind of armor, elytra can not be crafted and provide no defense benefit. However, when equipped in the chestplate slot, elytra allow the player to glide by holding in mid-air. Using a firework while gliding will boost the player upwards.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Different materials provide different amounts of protection. A full set of leather provides 7 points, gold provides 11 points, chainmail provides 12 points, iron provides 15 points, diamond provides 20 points, and netherite provides 20 points. These values combine with a number of other factors to determine how much damage the player takes from an attack.</p><h4>Combat Items</h4><p>The most direct method of protection against oncoming mobs and players alike, there are a number of combat items available to the player.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Sword</td><td>Swords are the primary melee weapon in Minecraft. They can also be used to swiftly cut through leaves and cobwebs. Its durability ratings are the same as those for the tools above.</td></tr><tr><td>Axe</td><td>A tool as well, axes can be used as an incredibly strong, albeit fairly slow, weapon.</td></tr><tr><td>Trident</td><td>A rare item, tridents can be used in melee, as well as thrown at enemies.</td></tr><tr><td>Shield</td><td>A defensive item, shields can be used to block most projectiles, as well as reduce damage taken from incoming attacks.</td></tr><tr><td>Bow</td><td>Bows can be used to launch arrows. Upon use the bow's arrow will be pulled back, increasing its damage the farther it is drawn.</td></tr><tr><td>Crossbow</td><td>Crossbows are a more advanced type of bow. The potential damage dealt by a crossbow is lower than that of a bow, but they can be pre-loaded in preparation of a fight, and can also be loaded with fireworks.</td></tr><tr><td>Arrows</td><td><p>Arrows act as ammunition for bows and crossbows. They are dropped by slain skeletons, and can be crafted from feathers, sticks and flint.</p></td></tr><tr><td>Firework</td><td><p>Fireworks are an ammunition type only usable with crossbows. Fireworks explode upon contact, <a href=\"/splash-damage/3015-347/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-347\">dealing damage in a radius</a>.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Swords and axes can be crafted from several materials (wood, stone, iron, gold, diamond, and netherite), increasing their durability and damage output.</p><h3>Food</h3><p>The player must eat to stay alive. Eating enables the player to regenerate health, as well as sprint, swim, and perform other physically demanding tasks.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Points</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Beetroot</td><td>1</td><td>Grown using beetroot seeds, or found in villages.</td></tr><tr><td>Dried Kelp</td><td>1</td><td>Made by cooking kelp in a furnace, smoker, or campfire.</td></tr><tr><td>Potato</td><td>1</td><td>Can be grown or found in villages.

There are four kinds of mobs: passive, neutral, hostile, and utility.</p><h3>Passive Mobs</h3><p>Passive Mobs will not attack the player under any circumstances.</p><p><b>Cow</b></p><p>Cows are useful for a variety of reasons, from dropping leather and steak upon being killed, to providing milk when interacted with using a bucket. In certain biomes, a variant known as the mooshroom spawns, which functions like a regular cow, with the exception of giving off mushroom stew when interacted with using a bowl. If the mooshroom is fed a flower before using the bowl, it will give off suspicious stew, a food item giving a random potion effect.</p><p><b>Pigs</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273883-pig.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273883\" data-ratio=\"0.92699724517906\" data-width=\"726\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 726px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:92.7%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273883-pig.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273883\"><img alt=\"A pig\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273883-pig.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273883-pig.png 726w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/38/386689/3273883-pig.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 726px) 100vw, 726px\" data-width=\"726\"></a><figcaption>A pig</figcaption></figure><p>Pigs drop pork chops when killed, which originally served as the primary source of healing in the game. If a pig is struck by lightning during a thunderstorm then it will become a zombified piglin; a mob otherwise only found in the hell underworld of the Nether. Saddles can be placed on pigs, allowing the player to ride on their back, however their movement can only be controlled using a carrot on a stick.</p><p><b>Chickens</b></p><p>Chickens can be killed for feathers; feathers are used to make arrows. If left alive, however, chickens can leave eggs on the ground. Since the beta 1.8 Adventure Update, chickens drop raw chicken when killed which can be cooked in a furnace.</p><p><b>Sheep</b></p><p>Originally sheep could be punched with any non-tool to shear them for 1-3 blocks of wool. After Beta version 1.7, however, punching sheep only hurts them. Instead, sheep must now be trimmed using shears which harvest 1-3 wool per sheep, with wool regrowing when a sheep eats grass.</p><p><b>Squid</b></p><p>Introduced in Beta 1.2, these mobs spawn only in water, and slowly suffocate if pushed onto land. While these animals are completely peaceful, they can be killed to gain ink packets, which can be turned into black dye. As of Java Edition 1.17, a variant known as glow squids will sometimes spawn, dropping glow ink sacs, which can be used to make certain blocks glow.</p><p><b>Villagers</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273850-villager.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273850\" data-ratio=\"2.0121951219512\" data-width=\"410\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 410px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:201.2%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273850-villager.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273850\"><img alt=\"A basic Villager\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px\" data-width=\"410\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273850-villager.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273850-villager.png 410w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A basic Villager\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273850-villager.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273850-villager.png 410w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 410px) 100vw, 410px\" data-width=\"410\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A basic Villager</figcaption></figure><p>Villagers are the NPCs who spawn in procedurally-generated villages. Originally they were meant to have names, though every last one of them had \"Testificate\" in their name plate -- a nickname that has stuck with them since their inception.</p><p>Villagers can be given jobs using special blocks, although some will generate already having jobs, due to villages generating said blocks. Once a villager is employed, they will trade with the player, offering various items in exchange for emeralds, as well as vice versa. Villagers' perception of the player is improved upon trading or otherwise helping them, however, attacking a villager will decrease their perception of the player. A village's perception of the player will impact the prices offered when trading.</p><p>Villages are common targets for attack, with zombies attacking at night to turn villagers into zombie villagers, and illagers attacking at certain times to destroy the village. During either event, villagers will run into the nearest house, seeking shelter. If a village is large enough it may attract an iron golem, which will fight hostile enemies automatically, defending the village.</p><p>A variant of the villager, known as the wandering trader, will sometimes spawn near the player. The wandering trader spawns with two llamas, and will offer random trades to the player for one in-game day, before disappearing at night.</p><h3>Neutral Mobs</h3><p>These mobs will leave the player alone until provoked. The action causing provocation and the behavior of the mobs after they have been provoked differs between mobs.</p><p><strong>Piglin</strong></p><p>Only found in the nether, adult piglins will attack the player on sight, unless they are wearing a piece of golden armor. Adult piglins wield golden swords and crossbows, however baby piglins lack weaponry, and will not attack the player whatsoever. Additionally, piglins will attack the player if the player attacks a piglin, or touches a block which contains items or gold. Piglins can be given gold ingots, at which point they will give the player a random item, even if they were previously hostile towards the player.</p><p>Zombified Piglin</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273851-zpiglin.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273851\" data-ratio=\"1.3333333333333\" data-width=\"450\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 450px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:133.3%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273851-zpiglin.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273851\"><img alt=\"A zombified piglin\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273851-zpiglin.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273851-zpiglin.png 450w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A zombified piglin\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273851-zpiglin.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273851-zpiglin.png 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" data-width=\"450\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A zombified piglin</figcaption></figure><p>Only found in the Nether, zombified piglins are peaceful with the player and will not attack unless provoked. They passively wander around and make sounds crossed between pigs and zombies. They become hostile and make loud angry shrieks when attacked or damaged, at which point any other zombified piglins in the area will also become hostile. A group of zombified piglins will generally overwhelm a single player. They wield Golden Swords and drop rotten flesh and gold nuggets upon death. They were originally zombie pigmen, however they were changed to be zombified piglins in Java Edition 1.16, with the introduction of piglins.</p><p><b>Wolves</b></p><p>Introduced in Beta 1.4, wolves are the game's first tameable pet. They can be tamed by feeding them 5-6 bones. Once tamed, hearts will appear and a red collar is present on their neck. The player can tame more than one. The wolves will follow the player character and teleport to them if they get too far away. If the player right-clicks on them they will sit, and if the player feeds them pork chops they will regain health. Their health meter is represented by their tail (vertical tail is full health, lowered is low health). They will attack any players or mobs that the player character attacks, and defend them. Mobs will not attack them. In the wild they are neutral but will attack if provoked. They are somewhat rare but commonly found in forest-type areas.</p><p><b>Ocelots</b></p><p>Introduced in Full Release 1.2, ocelots only spawn in jungle biomes, and purposely hunt down and kill certain passive mobs nearby. Ocelots scare easily and will flee at high speeds (the only mob currently capable of sprinting) if the player moves or even <em>looks around</em><i> </i>too suddenly near them, but will readily approach if the player holds raw cod or salmon in their hand. Feeding the ocelot will cause it to become trusting of the player, at which point it will no longer flee from them. Ocelots scare away creepers, and are immune to fall damage, but will not stick by the player's side like wolves do.</p><p><strong>Cats</strong></p><p>Originally obtained by taming an ocelot, cats became their own mob in Java Edition 1.14, spawning near villages and behaving similarly to ocelots. Cats are tamed in the same way as trust is gained with ocelots, but can be leashed before taming. Similarly to ocelots, cats are immune to fall damage and scare away creepers, as well as phantoms. There are 11 variants of cat, each based on real-life cat breeds, however the differences between them are purely visual.</p><p><strong>Horse</strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273854-horse.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273854\" data-ratio=\"1.085\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:108.5%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273854-horse.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273854\"><img alt=\"A white horse\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273854-horse.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273854-horse.png 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A white horse\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273854-horse.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273854-horse.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A white horse</figcaption></figure><p>Added in Full Release 1.6, horses are another tameable mob, such as wolves and cats. Horses are tamed by feeding them certain food items, or by attempting to ride on their back enough times. Once tamed, the player can put a saddle on the horse to ride it around, providing a faster means of transportation than walking. Horses can also be equipped with <a href=\"/horse-armor/3055-507/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-507\">horse armor</a>, protecting them from attacks. A variant of horses, the donkey, can also spawn. Donkeys can not be given horse armor, and are slower than normal horses, however they can be equipped with chests, allowing for easy transportation of large quantities of items. If a horse is bred with a donkey, the resulting offspring will be the otherwise unobtainable mule, which behaves like a donkey, albeit with a more wildly varying run-speed. Mules can not be bred with any other animal, even other mules.</p><p><strong>Llama</strong></p><p>Added in Full Release 1.11, Llamas function similarly to horses, donkeys, and mules, although they move slowly on their own, and can not be directed through riding. Instead, llamas are useful for carrying items long distances, accomplished by equipping them with a chest and items, and then leading them along with a lead. If one llama is led with a lead, nearby llamas will follow suit. If a llama or their owner are attacked, every nearby llama will spit at the attacker, damaging them slightly.</p><p><b>Enderman</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1851496\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1851496\"><img alt=\"An Enderman\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"An Enderman\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/0/8960/1851496-enderman.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>An Enderman</figcaption></figure><p>A slight reference to the popular internet creepypasta <a href=\"/slender-man/3005-23838/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-23838\">Slender Man</a>, endermen were added in Beta 1.8.

Incredibly powerful, with high health and a strong attack, golems are completely harmless to the player unless deliberately provoked. On occasion, iron golems will approach villager children and present them with roses, a reference to a scene from the film <i>Castle in the Sky</i>. Although they will automatically engage zombies and illagers upon detecting them, iron golems will also do battle with any mob that damages a villager in it's vicinity. They will also protect the player in this manner, making them handy to have around.

Each enemy type has its own special traits, and can be damaged with any item, however, items specifically intended as weapons (such as axes, swords, bows, and crossbows) are the most effective ways of combatting them.</p><p><b>Zombie</b></p><p>The most basic of enemies, zombies are slow and moan incoherently. They can only attack from a close proximity, and will slowly walk toward the player once they see them. Zombies ignore any non-player mobs nearby with the exception of villagers, wandering traders, and iron golems, who they will attack. Villagers killed by zombies turn into zombie villagers (although zombie villagers can also occur naturally), but can be cured with a potion of weakness and a golden apple. Aside from zombie villagers, three variants of zombies exist: chicken jockeys, husks and drowned. Chicken jockeys are rarely spawning baby zombies which ride on the back of chickens. Husks only spawn in deserts, and behave much like normal zombies. Drowned spawn in water, or when a normal zombie is underwater for too long. Naturally spawning drowned have a small chance to spawn with a trident, the only natural way of obtaining one in the game. Only normal zombies, zombie villagers, and chicken jockeys will catch on fire in direct sunlight, as husks are adjusted to hot desert climates, and drowned do not leave the water. When killed, zombies drop rotten flesh, with a rare chance to drop farming materials or iron ingots.</p><p><b>Skeleton</b></p><p>Skeletons are ranged opponents; only getting close enough to fire arrows at the player. Their movement patterns often involve circling the player as they get closer. Skeletons make a bone-clattering sound, but are more often identified by the sounds of their arrows being fired. Three variants of skeleton exist: spider jockeys, strays, and wither skeletons. Spider jockeys are skeletons which ride on the back of spiders, granting them faster movement speed than normal skeletons. Strays only spawn in snowy biomes, and fire arrows which inflict slowness upon the player. Wither Skeletons only spawn in Nether fortresses, and wield swords rather than bows. Wither Skeletons drop wither skeleton heads, a requirement for summoning The Wither. Skeletons drop bones and arrows when killed and all variants catch fire in direct sunlight, except for Wither Skeletons, who are immune to fire.</p><p><b>Spider</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273881-spider.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273881\" data-ratio=\"0.73020527859238\" data-width=\"341\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 341px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.0%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273881-spider.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273881\"><img alt=\"A spider\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px\" data-width=\"341\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273881-spider.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273881-spider.png 341w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A spider\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273881-spider.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273881-spider.png 341w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px\" data-width=\"341\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A spider</figcaption></figure><p>Spiders are dangerous foes, due to their ability to climb sheer walls. They move somewhat slowly but leap at the player once they are in range to do so. They are also only a single block tall but two blocks wide, allowing them to slip under narrow gaps. They make loud hissing noises and have no footsteps. Spiders are docile during the daytime, but will still attack if attacked first. A spider that becomes hostile to the player during the night will remain hostile to the player even once the sun rises only giving up once the player dies or it does. They have one variant, the cave spider. Cave spiders only occur undeground in mineshafts, and behave like a regular spider. Unlike regular spiders, however, cave spiders are smaller, and poison the player upon attacking. Both spiders and cave spiders drop string and spider eyes when killed.</p><p><b>Creeper</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/131021/1796814-200px_twocreepers.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1796814\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.015\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:201.5%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/131021/1796814-200px_twocreepers.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1796814\"><img alt=\"A creeper\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/131021/1796814-200px_twocreepers.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/131021/1796814-200px_twocreepers.png 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A creeper\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/131021/1796814-200px_twocreepers.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/13/131021/1796814-200px_twocreepers.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A creeper</figcaption></figure><p>Creepers are easily the most iconic mob in Minecraft, and are among the most dangerous. They have movement patterns almost identical to zombies, but Creepers make absolutely no noise unless within attack distance, at which point they will make a loud hissing noise (similar to lighting the fuse of an old-fashioned bomb), at which point they swell up and explode. This leaves the player about one second to get out of the blast radius, or to hit the creeper out of distance. The explosion is 75% the strength of TNT, and like TNT it destroys blocks around it and does less damage the further the player character is from the epicenter. If the player can distance the creeper from themself quickly enough, it will not explode, but will continue approaching the player until killed. Creepers drop gunpowder when killed by normal means but will not drop anything if they detonate. They also drop a vinyl record if they are killed by a skeleton's arrow. If a lightning bolt strikes near a creeper, they will become electrified and supercharged, causing their explosion to be much larger and much more powerful, often enough to kill a player in one hit. Creepers do not burn up in direct sunlight.</p><p><strong>Illager</strong></p><p>Illagers are evil versions of villagers, typically found in woodland mansions, illager outposts, or in raiding parties attacking villages. Visually similar to villagers, albeit with gray skin and different clothes, illagers are strong enemies which will attack the player on sight, and can destroy entire villages if not stopped. There are three types of illager: Pillagers, Evokers, and Vindicators. Pillagers carry crossbows and occur in raiding parties which attack villages every so often. Evokers have no weapon, instead casting various spells to attack their targets. Vindicators appear passive at first glance, however they will pull out an axe and begin running towards their target whenever they approach. Evokers and Vindicators both spawn naturally in woodland mansions, as well as spawning during later waves of village raids. Code for a fourth type of illager, the Illusioner, exists in the Java Edition of the game, however it is not present in the game itself except through use of commands or modifications.</p><p><strong>Phantom</strong></p><p>Phantoms are a special mob, only spawning when the player has not slept for three or more in-game days. They spawn in the sky above the player, circling overhead before swooping down to attack. They continue to spawn until the player rests in a bed, although they will catch on fire in direct sunlight. Upon death, phantoms sometimes drop phantom membranes, which can be used for powerful potions and repairing rare items.</p><p><b>Slime</b></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676246\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.77162629757785\" data-width=\"289\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 289px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:77.2%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676246\"><img alt=\"Some slimes\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" data-width=\"289\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png 289w\"><noscript><img alt=\"Some slimes\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/64233/1676246-slime1.png 289w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 289px) 100vw, 289px\" data-width=\"289\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Some slimes</figcaption></figure><p>Slimes are a rare enemy that only spawn deep underground in specific chunks of the world, or in swamps. Their attack is similar to a spider's, as they simply jump towards the player, albeit not as ferociously. Slimes can spawn in various sizes, and split apart when attacked. The smallest slimes cannot do damage to the player, but will still follow them around. They also can only move around by jumping making plopping sounds as they land. When killed they drop balls of green slime, which can be used to create sticky pistons and a number of other items.</p><p><strong>Guardian</strong></p><p>Guardians are a type of oceanic mob which only spawn in ocean monuments. They attack from a distance, swimming around to avoid the player while staying close enough to attack them. Within the heart of ocean monuments exists a variant of guardian, the Elder Guardian, which has significantly more health, does more damage, and inflicts mining fatigue on all nearby players.</p><p><strong>Magma Cube</strong></p><p>Magma cubes are similar to slimes, although they only spawn in the Nether, where they occur almost everywhere. They sport more health than a slime, deal more damage, and even deal damage when at their smallest size, unlike slimes. They are also immune to lava. When killed they drop magma cream, which can be used for potions of fire resistance.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676248\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.3976608187135\" data-width=\"342\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 342px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:139.8%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1676248\"><img alt=\"A Ghast\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px\" data-width=\"457\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png 342w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A Ghast\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/6/64233/1676248-ghast.png 342w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 457px) 100vw, 457px\" data-width=\"457\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Ghast</figcaption></figure><p><b>Ghasts</b></p><p>Found only in the Nether, ghasts are huge, floating creatures, characterized by their constant moaning when idle and blood-curdling screams when attacking. They launch explosive fireballs at the player that will destroy surrounding blocks, much like a creeper's explosion. It is possible to bounce the fireballs back at the ghast either by timing a hit on it with a sword or by shooting it with a bow and arrow. If a ghast manages to hit the player's portal to the real world with its fireball, the portal will close and will need to be re-ignited if the player wishes to leave. When ghasts are killed they drop gunpowder and ghast tears, valuable potion ingredients.</p><p>Originally, ghasts were intended to have a small chance of spawning near nether portals when the player returned to the overworld, however this was never implemented. In possible reference to this, there is a secret advancement for bringing a ghast to the surface, by drawing it through a nether portal.</p><p><strong>Hoglin</strong></p><p>Spawning in groups in the Nether's crimson forest biomes and in bastion remnants, hoglins are large, warthog-esque mobs. They attack players that get within 32 blocks of them, flinging the player into the air. If a hoglin somehow makes it out of the Nether, it will quickly zombify, turning into a zoglin. Upon death, a hoglin drops raw porkchops and leather, providing a valuable source of food in the Nether for those willing to pursue the dangerous mob.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/150889/2281097-blaze.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2281097\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"200\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"https://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/15/150889/2281097-blaze.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2281097\"><img alt=\"A blaze\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/15/150889/2281097-blaze.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/15/150889/2281097-blaze.png 200w\"><noscript><img alt=\"A blaze\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/15/150889/2281097-blaze.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/15/150889/2281097-blaze.png 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" data-width=\"200\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A blaze</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Blaze</strong></p><p>Blazes are mobs found in the Nether, usually spawning from monster spawners inside of Nether Fortresses.

Killing a shulker will drop a shulker shell, a prerequisite for making shulker boxes, a special storage item allowing players to carry far more items in their inventory.</p><h3>Boss Mobs</h3><p>Boss mobs are unique even among hostile mobs, due to their massively increased health, more complex AI, and the greater requirements to find and fight them. When a player is near a boss mob, a <a href=\"/enemy-health-indicator/3015-6203/\" data-ref-id=\"3015-6203\">health bar</a> will appear at the top of the screen, showing how much health the boss still has. Only two currently exist.</p><p><strong>The Ender Dragon</strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"medium\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/38/386689/3273892-enderdragon.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273892\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/38/386689/3273892-enderdragon.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3273892\"><img alt=\"The Ender Dragon\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/38/386689/3273892-enderdragon.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273892-enderdragon.png 1920w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/38/386689/3273892-enderdragon.png 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/38/386689/3273892-enderdragon.png 480w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Ender Dragon\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/38/386689/3273892-enderdragon.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3273892-enderdragon.png 1920w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_super/38/386689/3273892-enderdragon.png 960w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_medium/38/386689/3273892-enderdragon.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" data-width=\"960\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Ender Dragon</figcaption></figure><p>The Ender Dragon was the first boss mob introduced to Minecraft, added in the full release of the game. She can only be found in the End dimension, where she will spawn naturally upon a player's first arrival. The Ender Dragon flies around the main island of the End, occasionally swooping down to knock the player into the air, turning towards the player to shoot a fireball at them, temporarily burning the ground where the fireball lands, or flying towards a structure in the center of the island and stopping there briefly. As the Ender Dragon flies around, ender crystals positioned on the End's many obsidian towers will slowly regenerate her health, making it paramount that the player destroy the crystals before fighting the Ender Dragon.</p><p>Upon the dragon's death, the structure in the center of the End will complete itself, filling in with an inky void-like block, which when stepped in will show the player the game's credits and send them back to the Overworld. As well, an Ender Dragon egg with no functional use will appear atop the structure, and End gateways will appear at the outer rim of the island, allowing players to go to the far reaches of the End. The dragon can be resummoned by placing End crystals around the central structure, allowing it to be fought again. However, fighting it again will not spawn additional dragon eggs.</p><p><strong>The Wither<br /></strong></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-size=\"small\" data-img-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3277988-wither.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3277988\" data-ratio=\"1.0286085825748\" data-width=\"769\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 769px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:102.9%\" href=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3277988-wither.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-3277988\"><img alt=\"The Wither\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" data-width=\"622\" class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/38/386689/3277988-wither.png\" data-srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3277988-wither.png 769w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/38/386689/3277988-wither.png 622w\"><noscript><img alt=\"The Wither\" src=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/38/386689/3277988-wither.png\" srcset=\"https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/original/38/386689/3277988-wither.png 769w, https://www.giantbomb.com/a/uploads/scale_small/38/386689/3277988-wither.png 622w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 622px) 100vw, 622px\" data-width=\"622\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Wither</figcaption></figure><p>The second boss mob to be added to Minecraft, the Wither was introduced in Java Edition 1.4.2. The Wither is summoned by placing three Wither Skeleton skulls onto a T-shaped configuration of soul sand or soul soil, destroying the used items and spawning the Wither. When first spawning, the Wither is stationary for a moment as its health bar fills up, at which point it will explode, dealing damage to the surrounding environment and any nearby mobs, and make a sound audible to every player in the world, beginning the fight. The Wither tends to hover a few blocks above the ground, and fires exploding projectiles at all nearby mobs as it flies. In the Java Edition, getting the Wither below half health causes it to become immune to projectile damage, as well as flying closer to the ground. On Bedrock, it will create a sizable explosion, spawning three Wither Skeletons, and causing the Wither to take reduced damage for the rest of the fight.</p><p>Upon its death, the Wither drops a Nether star, an item required to create beacons, powerful structures which grant positive status effects to all players within a certain range.</p><h2>Soundtrack</h2><p>Most of the music and sound design for Minecraft was provided by <a href=\"/daniel-rosenfeld/3040-99250/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-99250\">Daniel \"C418\" Rosenfeld</a>, however later expansion packs and updates would introduce a number of songs from other composers. <a href=\"/gareth-coker/3040-140700/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-140700\">Gareth Coker</a> provided the music for every expansion pack made for the Bedrock Edition of Minecraft, while <a href=\"/lena-raine/3040-189371/\" data-ref-id=\"3040-189371\">Lena Raine</a> would provide four new songs (Chrysopoeia, Rubedo, So Below, and Pigstep), added in the 2020 Nether Update.</p><p>The game's soundtrack was released on March 4th, 2011, under the name <b>Minecraft: Volume Alpha</b>.

The suit also allows the player to resurrect as well as kill any lifeforms it sees.

so by sucking up the life energy of the surrounding area, meaning the player has to keep the environment alive in order for them to stay alive themselves.</p>", "expected_release_day": null,

Designed with support for VR full-body controls in mind, the game takes place in a free-form first-person perspective with most of the game's functions (such as each train's levers and buttons) being realistically interactive.</p><p>Unlike most other train driving simulators, Derail Valley takes a free-form career-based approach to the genre, rather than one based on fixed scenarios. Players earn money for randomly-generated delivery jobs, which can be used to pay for additional certifications (to unlock new types of jobs), for servicing the trains, and for paying off debts (occurred by damaging trains, traincars, and cargo).</p><p>Similar to some other freight-oriented train driving games, Derail Valley focuses on immersion with both the train driving and the delivery process, with players required to perform certain actions to complete their delivery (such as moving their trains into position, coupling/decoupling traincars, and managing railroad switches). The game is heavily physics-based, with the possibility for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derailment\" data-target=\"true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">derailment</a> and, for certain types of cargo, catastrophic explosions.</p>", "expected_release_day": null, "expected_release_month": null, "expected_release_quarter": null, "expected_release_year": null, "guid":
